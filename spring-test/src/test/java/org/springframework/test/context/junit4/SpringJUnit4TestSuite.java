/**
 * JUnit test suite for tests involving {@link SpringRunner} and the

 * convenience.
 *
 * <p>This test suite serves a dual purpose of verifying that tests run with
 * {@link SpringRunner} can be used in conjunction with JUnit's
 * {@link Suite} runner.
 *
 * <p>Note that tests included in this suite will be executed at least twice if
 * run from an automated build process, test runner, etc. that is not configured
 * to exclude tests based on a {@code "*TestSuite.class"} pattern match.
