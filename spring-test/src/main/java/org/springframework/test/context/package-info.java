/**
 * <p>This package contains the <em>Spring TestContext Framework</em>
 * which provides annotation-driven unit and integration testing support
 * that is agnostic of the actual testing framework in use. The same
 * techniques and annotation-based configuration used in, for example, a
 * JUnit 3.8 environment can also be applied to tests written with JUnit
 * 4.5+, TestNG, etc.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In addition to providing generic and extensible testing
 * infrastructure, the Spring TestContext Framework provides out-of-the-box
 * support for Spring-specific integration testing functionality such as
 * context management and caching, dependency injection of test fixtures,
 * and transactional test management with default rollback semantics.</p>
