/**
 * Mark a <em>composed annotation</em> as eligible for Bean Override processing.
 *
 * <p>Specifying this annotation registers the configured {@link BeanOverrideProcessor}
 * which must be capable of handling the composed annotation and its attributes.
 *
 * <p>Since the composed annotation will typically only be applied to non-static
 * fields, it is expected that the composed annotation is meta-annotated with
 * {@link Target @Target(ElementType.FIELD)}. However, certain bean override
 * annotations may be declared with an additional {@code ElementType.TYPE} target
 * for use at the type level, as is the case for {@code @MockitoBean} which can
 * be declared on a field, test class, or test interface.
 *
 * <p>For concrete examples of such composed annotations, see
 * {@link org.springframework.test.context.bean.override.convention.TestBean @TestBean},
 * {@link org.springframework.test.context.bean.override.mockito.MockitoBean @MockitoBean}, and
 * {@link org.springframework.test.context.bean.override.mockito.MockitoSpyBean @MockitoSpyBean}.
