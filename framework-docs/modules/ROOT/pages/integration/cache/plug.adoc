Clearly, there are plenty of caching products out there that you can use as a backing
store. For those that do not support JSR-107 you need to provide a `CacheManager` and a
`Cache` implementation. This may sound harder than it is, since, in practice, the classes
tend to be simple https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern[adapters] that map the
caching abstraction framework on top of the storage API, as the _Caffeine_ classes do.
Most `CacheManager` classes can use the classes in the
`org.springframework.cache.support` package (such as `AbstractCacheManager` which takes
care of the boiler-plate code, leaving only the actual mapping to be completed).
