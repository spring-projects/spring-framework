= Apache Groovy
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed, and dynamic language, with static-typing and static
compilation capabilities. It offers a concise syntax and integrates smoothly with any
existing Java application.

The Spring Framework provides a dedicated `ApplicationContext` that supports a Groovy-based
Bean Definition DSL. For more details, see
xref:core/beans/basics.adoc#beans-factory-groovy[The Groovy Bean Definition DSL].

Further support for Groovy, including beans written in Groovy, refreshable script beans,
and more is available in xref:languages/dynamic.adoc[Dynamic Language Support].
