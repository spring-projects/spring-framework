[[spring-web-reactive]]
= Web on Reactive Stack

This part of the documentation covers support for reactive-stack web applications built
on a {reactive-streams-site}/[Reactive Streams] API to run on non-blocking servers,
such as Netty and Servlet containers. Individual chapters cover
the xref:web/webflux.adoc#webflux[Spring WebFlux] framework,
the reactive xref:web/webflux-webclient.adoc[`WebClient`],
support for xref:web/webflux-test.adoc[testing],
and xref:web/webflux-reactive-libraries.adoc[reactive libraries].

For Servlet-stack web applications, see xref:web.adoc[Web on Servlet Stack].
