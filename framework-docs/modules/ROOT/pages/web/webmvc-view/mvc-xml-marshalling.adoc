= XML Marshalling
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

The `MarshallingView` uses an XML `Marshaller` (defined in the `org.springframework.oxm`
package) to render the response content as XML. You can explicitly set the object to be
marshalled by using a `MarshallingView` instance's `modelKey` bean property. Alternatively,
the view iterates over all model properties and marshals the first type that is supported
by the `Marshaller`. For more information on the functionality in the
`org.springframework.oxm` package, see xref:data-access/oxm.adoc[Marshalling XML using O/X Mappers].
