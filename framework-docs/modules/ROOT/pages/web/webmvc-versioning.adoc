Spring MVC supports API versioning. This section provides an overview of the support
and underlying strategies.

Please, see also related content in:

- Configure xref:web/webmvc/mvc-config/api-version.adoc[API versioning] in the MVC Config
- xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-requestmapping.adoc#mvc-ann-requestmapping-version[Map requests]
to annotated controller methods with an API version
- xref:web/webmvc-functional.adoc#api-version[Route requests]
to functional endpoints with an API version

Client support for API versioning is available also in `RestClient`, `WebClient`, and
xref:integration/rest-clients.adoc#rest-http-interface[HTTP Service] clients, as well as
for testing in MockMvc and `WebTestClient`.




[[mvc-versioning-strategy]]
== ApiVersionStrategy
[.small]#xref:web/webflux-versioning.adoc#webflux-versioning-strategy[See equivalent in the Reactive stack]#

This is the central strategy for API versioning that holds all configured preferences
related to versioning. It does the following:

- Resolves versions from the requests via xref:#mvc-versioning-resolver[ApiVersionResolver]
- Parses raw version values into `Comparable<?>` with an xref:#mvc-versioning-parser[ApiVersionParser]
- xref:#mvc-versioning-validation[Validates] request versions
- Sends deprecation hints in the responses

`ApiVersionStrategy` helps to map requests to `@RequestMapping` controller methods,
and is initialized by the MVC config. Typically, applications do not interact
directly with it.




[[mvc-versioning-resolver]]
== ApiVersionResolver
[.small]#xref:web/webflux-versioning.adoc#webflux-versioning-resolver[See equivalent in the Reactive stack]#

This strategy resolves the API version from a request. The MVC config provides built-in
options to resolve from a header, query parameter, media type parameter,
or from the URL path. You can also use a custom `ApiVersionResolver`.

NOTE: The path resolver always resolves the version from the specified path segment, or
raises `InvalidApiVersionException` otherwise, and therefore it cannot yield to other
resolvers.





[[mvc-versioning-parser]]
== ApiVersionParser
[.small]#xref:web/webflux-versioning.adoc#webflux-versioning-parser[See equivalent in the Reactive stack]#

This strategy helps to parse raw version values into `Comparable<?>`, which helps to
compare, sort, and select versions. By default, the built-in `SemanticApiVersionParser`
parses a version into `major`, `minor`, and `patch` integer values. Minor and patch
values are set to 0 if not present.




[[mvc-versioning-validation]]
== Validation
[.small]#xref:web/webflux-versioning.adoc#webflux-versioning-validation[See equivalent in the Reactive stack]#

If a request version is not supported, `InvalidApiVersionException` is raised resulting
in a 400 response. By default, the list of supported versions is initialized from declared
versions in annotated controller mappings, but you can turn that off through a flag in the
MVC config, and use only the versions configured explicitly in the config.

By default, a version is required when API versioning is enabled, and
`MissingApiVersionException` is raised resulting in a 400 response if not present.
You can make it optional in which case the most recent version is used.
You can also specify a default version to use.




[[mvc-versioning-deprecation-handler]]
== ApiVersionDeprecationHandler
[.small]#xref:web/webflux-versioning.adoc#webflux-versioning-deprecation-handler[See equivalent in the Reactive stack]#

This strategy can be configured to send hints and information about deprecated versions to
clients via response headers. The built-in `StandardApiVersionDeprecationHandler`
can set the "Deprecation" "Sunset" headers and "Link" headers as defined in
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9745[RFC 9745] and
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8594[RFC 8594]. You can also configure a custom
handler for different headers.




[[mvc-versioning-mapping]]
== Request Mapping
[.small]#xref:web/webflux-versioning.adoc#webflux-versioning-mapping[See equivalent in the Reactive stack]#

`ApiVersionStrategy` supports the mapping of requests to annotated controller methods.
See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-requestmapping.adoc#mvc-ann-requestmapping-version[API Version]
for more details.
