Spring MVC supports https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#section-14[RFC 9110]
range requests. For an overview, see the
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Range_requests[Ranger Requests]
Mozilla guide.

The `Range` header is parsed and handled transparently in Spring MVC when an annotated
controller returns a `Resource` or `ResponseEntity<Resource>`, or a functional endpoint
xref:web/webmvc-functional.adoc#webmvc-fn-resources[serves a `Resource`]. `Range` header
support is also transparently handled when serving
xref:web/webmvc/mvc-config/static-resources.adoc[static resources].

TIP: The `Resource` must not be an `InputStreamResource` and with `ResponseEntity<Resource>`,
the status of the response must be 200.

The underlying support is in the `HttpRange` class, which exposes methods to parse
`Range` headers and split a `Resource` into a `List<ResourceRegion>` that in turn can be
then written to the response via `ResourceRegionHttpMessageConverter`.
