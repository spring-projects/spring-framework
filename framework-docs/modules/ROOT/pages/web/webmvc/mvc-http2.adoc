Servlet 4 containers are required to support HTTP/2, and Spring Framework 5 is compatible
with Servlet API 4. From a programming model perspective, there is nothing specific that
applications need to do. However, there are considerations related to server configuration.
For more details, see the
{spring-framework-wiki}/HTTP-2-support[HTTP/2 wiki page].

The Servlet API does expose one construct related to HTTP/2. You can use the
`jakarta.servlet.http.PushBuilder` to proactively push resources to clients, and it
is supported as a xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/arguments.adoc[method argument] to `@RequestMapping` methods.
