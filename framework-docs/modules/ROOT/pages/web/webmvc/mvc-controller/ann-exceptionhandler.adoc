[.small]#xref:web/webflux/controller/ann-exceptions.adoc[See equivalent in the Reactive stack]#

`@Controller` and xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-advice.adoc[@ControllerAdvice] classes can have
`@ExceptionHandler` methods to handle exceptions from controller methods, as the following example shows:


include-code::./SimpleController[indent=0]


[[mvc-ann-exceptionhandler-exc]]
== Exception Mapping

The exception may match against a top-level exception being propagated (for example, a direct
`IOException` being thrown) or against a nested cause within a wrapper exception (for example,
an `IOException` wrapped inside an `IllegalStateException`). As of 5.3, this can match
at arbitrary cause levels, whereas previously only an immediate cause was considered.

For matching exception types, preferably declare the target exception as a method argument,
as the preceding example shows. When multiple exception methods match, a root exception match is
generally preferred to a cause exception match. More specifically, the `ExceptionDepthComparator`
is used to sort exceptions based on their depth from the thrown exception type.

Alternatively, the annotation declaration may narrow the exception types to match,
as the following example shows:

include-code::./ExceptionController[tag=narrow,indent=0]

You can even use a list of specific exception types with a very generic argument signature,
as the following example shows:

include-code::./ExceptionController[tag=general,indent=0]


[NOTE]
====
The distinction between root and cause exception matching can be surprising.

In the `IOException` variant shown earlier, the method is typically called with
the actual `FileSystemException` or `RemoteException` instance as the argument,
since both of them extend from `IOException`. However, if any such matching
exception is propagated within a wrapper exception which is itself an `IOException`,
the passed-in exception instance is that wrapper exception.

The behavior is even simpler in the `handle(Exception)` variant. This is
always invoked with the wrapper exception in a wrapping scenario, with the
actually matching exception to be found through `ex.getCause()` in that case.
The passed-in exception is the actual `FileSystemException` or
`RemoteException` instance only when these are thrown as top-level exceptions.
====

We generally recommend that you be as specific as possible in the argument signature,
reducing the potential for mismatches between root and cause exception types.
Consider breaking a multi-matching method into individual `@ExceptionHandler`
methods, each matching a single specific exception type through its signature.

In a multi-`@ControllerAdvice` arrangement, we recommend declaring your primary root exception
mappings on a `@ControllerAdvice` prioritized with a corresponding order. While a root
exception match is preferred to a cause, this is defined among the methods of a given
controller or `@ControllerAdvice` class. This means a cause match on a higher-priority
`@ControllerAdvice` bean is preferred to any match (for example, root) on a lower-priority
`@ControllerAdvice` bean.

Last but not least, an `@ExceptionHandler` method implementation can choose to back
out of dealing with a given exception instance by rethrowing it in its original form.
This is useful in scenarios where you are interested only in root-level matches or in
matches within a specific context that cannot be statically determined. A rethrown
exception is propagated through the remaining resolution chain, as though
the given `@ExceptionHandler` method would not have matched in the first place.

Support for `@ExceptionHandler` methods in Spring MVC is built on the `DispatcherServlet`
level, xref:web/webmvc/mvc-servlet/exceptionhandlers.adoc[HandlerExceptionResolver] mechanism.



[[mvc-ann-exceptionhandler-media]]
== Media Type Mapping
[.small]#xref:web/webflux/controller/ann-exceptions.adoc#webflux-ann-exceptionhandler-media[See equivalent in the Reactive stack]#

In addition to exception types, `@ExceptionHandler` methods can also declare producible media types.
This allows to refine error responses depending on the media types requested by HTTP clients, typically in the "Accept" HTTP request header.

Applications can declare producible media types directly on annotations, for the same exception type:


include-code::./MediaTypeController[tag=mediatype,indent=0]

Here, methods handle the same exception type but will not be rejected as duplicates.
Instead, API clients requesting "application/json" will receive a JSON error, and browsers will get an HTML error view.
Each `@ExceptionHandler` annotation can declare several producible media types,
the content negotiation during the error handling phase will decide which content type will be used.


[[mvc-ann-exceptionhandler-args]]
== Method Arguments
[.small]#xref:web/webflux/controller/ann-exceptions.adoc#webflux-ann-exceptionhandler-args[See equivalent in the Reactive stack]#

`@ExceptionHandler` methods support the following arguments:

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Method argument | Description

| Exception type
| For access to the raised exception.

| `HandlerMethod`
| For access to the controller method that raised the exception.

| `WebRequest`, `NativeWebRequest`
| Generic access to request parameters and request and session attributes without direct
  use of the Servlet API.

| `jakarta.servlet.ServletRequest`, `jakarta.servlet.ServletResponse`
| Choose any specific request or response type (for example, `ServletRequest` or
  `HttpServletRequest` or Spring's `MultipartRequest` or `MultipartHttpServletRequest`).

| `jakarta.servlet.http.HttpSession`
| Enforces the presence of a session. As a consequence, such an argument is never `null`. +
  Note that session access is not thread-safe. Consider setting the
  `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter` instance's `synchronizeOnSession` flag to `true` if multiple
  requests are allowed to access a session concurrently.

| `java.security.Principal`
| Currently authenticated user -- possibly a specific `Principal` implementation class if known.

| `HttpMethod`
| The HTTP method of the request.

| `java.util.Locale`
| The current request locale, determined by the most specific `LocaleResolver` available -- in
  effect, the configured `LocaleResolver` or `LocaleContextResolver`.

| `java.util.TimeZone`, `java.time.ZoneId`
| The time zone associated with the current request, as determined by a `LocaleContextResolver`.

| `java.io.OutputStream`, `java.io.Writer`
| For access to the raw response body, as exposed by the Servlet API.

| `java.util.Map`, `org.springframework.ui.Model`, `org.springframework.ui.ModelMap`
| For access to the model for an error response. Always empty.

| `RedirectAttributes`
| Specify attributes to use in case of a redirect -- (that is to be appended to the query
  string) and flash attributes to be stored temporarily until the request after the redirect.
  See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/redirecting-passing-data.adoc[Redirect Attributes] and xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/flash-attributes.adoc[Flash Attributes].

| `@SessionAttribute`
| For access to any session attribute, in contrast to model attributes stored in the
  session as a result of a class-level `@SessionAttributes` declaration.
  See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/sessionattribute.adoc[`@SessionAttribute`] for more details.

| `@RequestAttribute`
| For access to request attributes. See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/requestattrib.adoc[`@RequestAttribute`] for more details.

[[mvc-ann-exceptionhandler-return-values]]
== Return Values
[.small]#xref:web/webflux/controller/ann-exceptions.adoc#webflux-ann-exceptionhandler-return-values[See equivalent in the Reactive stack]#

`@ExceptionHandler` methods support the following return values:

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Return value | Description

| `@ResponseBody`
| The return value is converted through `HttpMessageConverter` instances and written to the
  response. See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/responsebody.adoc[`@ResponseBody`].

| `HttpEntity<B>`, `ResponseEntity<B>`
| The return value specifies that the full response (including the HTTP headers and the body)
  be converted through `HttpMessageConverter` instances and written to the response.
  See xref:web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/responseentity.adoc[ResponseEntity].

| `ErrorResponse`, `ProblemDetail`
| To render an RFC 9457 error response with details in the body,
  see xref:web/webmvc/mvc-ann-rest-exceptions.adoc[Error Responses]

| `String`
| A view name to be resolved with `ViewResolver` implementations and used together with the
  implicit model -- determined through command objects and `@ModelAttribute` methods.
  The handler method can also programmatically enrich the model by declaring a `Model`
  argument (described earlier).

| `View`
| A `View` instance to use for rendering together with the implicit model -- determined
  through command objects and `@ModelAttribute` methods. The handler method may also
  programmatically enrich the model by declaring a `Model` argument (descried earlier).

| `java.util.Map`, `org.springframework.ui.Model`
| Attributes to be added to the implicit model with the view name implicitly determined
  through a `RequestToViewNameTranslator`.

| `@ModelAttribute`
| An attribute to be added to the model with the view name implicitly determined through
  a `RequestToViewNameTranslator`.

  Note that `@ModelAttribute` is optional. See "`Any other return value`" at the end of
  this table.

| `ModelAndView` object
| The view and model attributes to use and, optionally, a response status.

| `void`
| A method with a `void` return type (or `null` return value) is considered to have fully
  handled the response if it also has a `ServletResponse` an `OutputStream` argument, or
  a `@ResponseStatus` annotation. The same is also true if the controller has made a positive
  `ETag` or `lastModified` timestamp check (see xref:web/webmvc/mvc-caching.adoc#mvc-caching-etag-lastmodified[Controllers] for details).

  If none of the above is true, a `void` return type can also indicate "`no response body`" for
  REST controllers or default view name selection for HTML controllers.

| Any other return value
| If a return value is not matched to any of the above and is not a simple type (as determined by
  {spring-framework-api}/beans/BeanUtils.html#isSimpleProperty-java.lang.Class-[BeanUtils#isSimpleProperty]),
  by default, it is treated as a model attribute to be added to the model. If it is a simple type,
  it remains unresolved.
