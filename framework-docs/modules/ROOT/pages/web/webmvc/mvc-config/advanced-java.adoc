= Advanced Java Config

`@EnableWebMvc` imports `DelegatingWebMvcConfiguration`, which:

* Provides default Spring configuration for Spring MVC applications
* Detects and delegates to `WebMvcConfigurer` implementations to customize that configuration.

For advanced mode, you can remove `@EnableWebMvc` and extend directly from
`DelegatingWebMvcConfiguration` instead of implementing `WebMvcConfigurer`,
as the following example shows:

include-code::./WebConfiguration[tag=snippet,indent=0]

You can keep existing methods in `WebConfig`, but you can now also override bean declarations
from the base class, and you can still have any number of other `WebMvcConfigurer` implementations on
the classpath.
