= Enable STOMP

STOMP over WebSocket support is available in the `spring-messaging` and
`spring-websocket` modules. Once you have those dependencies, you can expose a STOMP
endpoint over WebSocket, as the following example shows:

include-code::./WebSocketConfiguration[tag=snippet,indent=0]

NOTE: For the built-in simple broker, the `/topic` and `/queue` prefixes do not have any special
meaning. They are merely a convention to differentiate between pub-sub versus point-to-point
messaging (that is, many subscribers versus one consumer). When you use an external broker,
check the STOMP page of the broker to understand what kind of STOMP destinations and
prefixes it supports.

To connect from a browser, for STOMP, you can use
https://github.com/stomp-js/stompjs[`stomp-js/stompjs`] which is the most
actively maintained JavaScript library.

The following example code is based on it:

[source,javascript,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	const stompClient = new StompJs.Client({
		brokerURL: 'ws://domain.com/portfolio',
		onConnect: () => {
			// ...
		}
	});
----

Alternatively, if you connect through SockJS, you can enable the
xref:web/websocket/fallback.adoc[SockJS Fallback] on server-side with
`registry.addEndpoint("/portfolio").withSockJS()` and on JavaScript side,
by following
https://stomp-js.github.io/guide/stompjs/rx-stomp/using-stomp-with-sockjs.html[those instructions].

Note that `stompClient` in the preceding example does not need to specify `login`
and `passcode` headers. Even if it did, they would be ignored (or, rather,
overridden) on the server side. See xref:web/websocket/stomp/handle-broker-relay-configure.adoc[Connecting to a Broker]
and xref:web/websocket/stomp/authentication.adoc[Authentication] for more information on authentication.
