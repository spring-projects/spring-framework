[[null-safety]]
= Null-safety

Although Java does not let you express nullness markers with its type system yet, the Spring Framework codebase is
annotated with https://jspecify.dev/docs/start-here/[JSpecify] annotations to declare the nullability of its APIs,
fields, and related type usages. Reading the https://jspecify.dev/docs/user-guide/[JSpecify user guide] is highly
recommended in order to get familiar with those annotations and semantics.

The primary goal of this null-safety arrangement is to prevent a `NullPointerException` from being thrown at runtime via build
time checks and to use explicit nullability as a way to express the possible absence of value. It is useful in both
Java by leveraging some tooling (https://github.com/uber/NullAway[NullAway] or IDEs supporting JSpecify annotations
such as IntelliJ IDEA) and Kotlin where JSpecify annotations are automatically translated to
{kotlin-docs}/null-safety.html[Kotlin's null safety].

The {spring-framework-api}/core/Nullness.html[`Nullness` Spring API] can be used at runtime to detect the nullness of a
type usage, a field, a method return type, or a parameter. It provides full support for JSpecify annotations,
Kotlin null safety, and Java primitive types, as well as a pragmatic check on any `@Nullable` annotation (regardless of the
package).

[[null-safety-libraries]]
== Annotating libraries with JSpecify annotations

As of Spring Framework 7, the Spring Framework codebase leverages JSpecify annotations to expose null-safe APIs and
to check the consistency of those nullability declarations with https://github.com/uber/NullAway[NullAway] as part of
its build. It is recommended for each library depending on Spring Framework and Spring portfolio projects, as
well as other libraries related to the Spring ecosystem (Reactor, Micrometer, and Spring community projects), to do the
same.

[[null-safety-applications]]
== Leveraging JSpecify annotations in Spring applications

Developing applications with IDEs that support nullness annotations will provide warnings in Java and errors in Kotlin
when the nullability contracts are not honored, allowing Spring application developers to refine their null handling to
prevent a `NullPointerException` from being thrown at runtime.

Optionally, Spring application developers can annotate their codebase and use build plugins like
https://github.com/uber/NullAway[NullAway] to enforce null-safety at the application level during build time.

[[null-safety-guidelines]]
== Guidelines

The purpose of this section is to share some proposed guidelines for explicitly specifying the nullability of
Spring-related libraries or applications.


[[null-safety-guidelines-jspecify]]
=== JSpecify

The key points to understand are that the nullness of types is unknown in Java by default and that non-null type
usage is by far more frequent than nullable usage. In order to keep codebases readable, we typically want to define
by default that type usage is non-null unless marked as nullable for a specific scope. This is exactly the purpose of
https://jspecify.dev/docs/api/org/jspecify/annotations/NullMarked.html[`@NullMarked`] which is typically set in Spring
projects at the package level via a `package-info.java` file, for example:

[source,java,subs="verbatim,quotes",chomp="-packages",fold="none"]
----
@NullMarked
package org.springframework.core;

import org.jspecify.annotations.NullMarked;
----

In the various Java files belonging to the package, nullable type usage is defined explicitly with
https://jspecify.dev/docs/api/org/jspecify/annotations/Nullable.html[`@Nullable`]. It is recommended that this
annotation is specified just before the related type on the same line.

For example, for a field:

[source,java,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
private @Nullable String fileEncoding;
----

Or for method parameters and method return types:

[source,java,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public static @Nullable String buildMessage(@Nullable String message,
                                            @Nullable Throwable cause) {
    // ...
}
----

[NOTE]
====
When overriding a method, JSpecify annotations are not inherited from the original
method. That means the JSpecify annotations should be copied to the overriding method if
you want to override the implementation and keep the same nullability semantics.
====

With arrays and varargs, you need to be able to differentiate the nullness of the elements from the nullness of
the array itself. Pay attention to the syntax
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.7.4[defined by the Java specification] which may be
initially surprising:

- `@Nullable Object[] array` means individual elements can be null but the array itself cannot.
- `Object @Nullable [] array` means individual elements cannot be null but the array itself can.
- `@Nullable Object @Nullable [] array` means both individual elements and the array can be null.

The Java specification also enforces that annotations defined with `@Target(ElementType.TYPE_USE)` like JSpecify
`@Nullable` should be specified after the last `.` with inner or fully qualified types:

 - `Cache.@Nullable ValueWrapper`
 - `jakarta.validation.@Nullable Validator`

https://jspecify.dev/docs/api/org/jspecify/annotations/NonNull.html[`@NonNull`] and
https://jspecify.dev/docs/api/org/jspecify/annotations/NullUnmarked.html[`@NullUnmarked`] should rarely be needed for
typical use cases.

[[null-safety-guidelines-nullaway]]
=== NullAway

==== Configuration

The recommended configuration is:

 - `NullAway:OnlyNullMarked=true` in order to perform nullability checks only for packages annotated with `@NullMarked`.
 - `NullAway:CustomContractAnnotations=org.springframework.lang.Contract` which makes NullAway aware of the
{spring-framework-api}/lang/Contract.html[@Contract] annotation in the `org.springframework.lang` package which
can be used to express complementary semantics to avoid irrelevant warnings in your codebase.

A good example of the benefits of a `@Contract` declaration can be seen with
{spring-framework-api}/util/Assert.html#notNull(java.lang.Object,java.lang.String)[`Assert.notNull()`] which is annotated
with `@Contract("null, _ -> fail")`. With that contract declaration, NullAway will understand that the value passed as a
parameter cannot be null after a successful invocation of `Assert.notNull()`.

Optionally, it is possible to set `NullAway:JSpecifyMode=true` to enable
https://github.com/uber/NullAway/wiki/JSpecify-Support[checks on the full JSpecify semantics], including annotations on
generic types. Be aware that this mode is
https://github.com/uber/NullAway/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ajspecify[still under development] and requires
using JDK 22 or later (typically combined with the `--release` Java compiler flag to configure the
expected baseline). It is recommended to enable the JSpecify mode only as a second step, after making sure the codebase
generates no warning with the recommended configuration mentioned previously in this section.

==== Warnings suppression

There are a few valid use cases where NullAway will incorrectly detect nullability problems. In such case, it is recommended
to suppress related warnings and to document the reason:

 - `@SuppressWarnings("NullAway.Init")` at field, constructor, or class level can be used to avoid unnecessary warnings
due to the lazy initialization of fields â€“ for example, due to a class implementing
{spring-framework-api}/beans/factory/InitializingBean.html[`InitializingBean`].
 - `@SuppressWarnings("NullAway") // Dataflow analysis limitation` can be used when NullAway dataflow analysis is not
able to detect that the path involving a nullability problem will never happen.
 - `@SuppressWarnings("NullAway") // Lambda` can be used when NullAway does not take into account assertions performed
outside of a lambda for the code path within the lambda.
- `@SuppressWarnings("NullAway") // Reflection` can be used for some reflection operations that are known to return
non-null values even if that cannot be expressed by the API.
- `@SuppressWarnings("NullAway") // Well-known map keys` can be used when `Map#get` invocations are performed with keys that are known
to be present and when non-null related values have been inserted previously.
- `@SuppressWarnings("NullAway") // Overridden method does not define nullability` can be used when the superclass does
not define nullability (typically when the superclass comes from a dependency).


[[null-safety-migrating]]
== Migrating from Spring null-safety annotations

Spring null-safety annotations {spring-framework-api}/lang/Nullable.html[`@Nullable`],
{spring-framework-api}/lang/NonNull.html[`@NonNull`],
{spring-framework-api}/lang/NonNullApi.html[`@NonNullApi`], and
{spring-framework-api}/lang/NonNullFields.html[`@NonNullFields`] in the `org.springframework.lang` package were
introduced in Spring Framework 5 when JSpecify did not exist, and the best option at that time was to leverage
meta-annotations from JSR 305 (a dormant but widespread JSR). They are deprecated as of Spring Framework 7 in favor of
https://jspecify.dev/docs/start-here/[JSpecify] annotations, which provide significant enhancements such as properly
defined specifications, a canonical dependency with no split-package issues, better tooling, better Kotlin integration,
and the capability to specify nullability more precisely for more use cases.

A key difference is that Spring's deprecated null-safety annotations, which follow JSR 305 semantics, apply to fields,
parameters, and return values; while JSpecify annotations apply to type usage. This subtle difference
is in practice pretty significant, as it allows developers to differentiate between the nullness of elements and the
nullness of arrays/varargs as well as to define the nullness of generic types.

That means array and varargs null-safety declarations have to be updated to keep the same semantics. For example
`@Nullable Object[] array` with Spring annotations needs to be changed to `Object @Nullable [] array` with JSpecify
annotations. The same applies to varargs.

It is also recommended to move field and return value annotations closer to the type and on the same line, for example:

 - For fields, instead of `@Nullable private String field` with Spring annotations, use `private @Nullable String field`
with JSpecify annotations.
- For method return types, instead of `@Nullable public String method()` with Spring annotations, use
`public @Nullable String method()` with JSpecify annotations.

Also, with JSpecify, you do not need to specify `@NonNull` when overriding a type usage annotated with `@Nullable` in the
super method to "undo" the nullable declaration in null-marked code. Just declare it unannotated and the null-marked
defaults (a type usage is considered non-null unless explicitly annotated as nullable) will apply.
