[[context-introduction]]
= Additional Capabilities of the `ApplicationContext`

As discussed in the xref:core/beans/introduction.adoc[chapter introduction], the `org.springframework.beans.factory`
package provides basic functionality for managing and manipulating beans, including in a
programmatic way. The `org.springframework.context` package adds the
{spring-framework-api}/context/ApplicationContext.html[`ApplicationContext`]
interface, which extends the `BeanFactory` interface, in addition to extending other
interfaces to provide additional functionality in a more application
framework-oriented style. Many people use the `ApplicationContext` in a completely
declarative fashion, not even creating it programmatically, but instead relying on
support classes such as `ContextLoader` to automatically instantiate an
`ApplicationContext` as part of the normal startup process of a Jakarta EE web application.

To enhance `BeanFactory` functionality in a more framework-oriented style, the context
package also provides the following functionality:

* Access to messages in i18n-style, through the `MessageSource` interface.
* Access to resources, such as URLs and files, through the `ResourceLoader` interface.
* Event publication, namely to beans that implement the `ApplicationListener` interface,
  through the use of the `ApplicationEventPublisher` interface.
* Loading of multiple (hierarchical) contexts, letting each be focused on one
  particular layer, such as the web layer of an application, through the
  `HierarchicalBeanFactory` interface.



[[context-functionality-messagesource]]
== Internationalization using `MessageSource`

The `ApplicationContext` interface extends an interface called `MessageSource` and,
therefore, provides internationalization ("`i18n`") functionality. Spring also provides the
`HierarchicalMessageSource` interface, which can resolve messages hierarchically.
Together, these interfaces provide the foundation upon which Spring effects message
resolution. The methods defined on these interfaces include:

* `String getMessage(String code, Object[] args, String default, Locale loc)`: The basic
  method used to retrieve a message from the `MessageSource`. When no message is found
  for the specified locale, the default message is used. Any arguments passed in become
  replacement values, using the `MessageFormat` functionality provided by the standard
  library.
* `String getMessage(String code, Object[] args, Locale loc)`: Essentially the same as
  the previous method but with one difference: No default message can be specified. If
  the message cannot be found, a `NoSuchMessageException` is thrown.
* `String getMessage(MessageSourceResolvable resolvable, Locale locale)`: All properties
  used in the preceding methods are also wrapped in a class named
  `MessageSourceResolvable`, which you can use with this method.

When an `ApplicationContext` is loaded, it automatically searches for a `MessageSource`
bean defined in the context. The bean must have the name `messageSource`. If such a bean
is found, all calls to the preceding methods are delegated to the message source. If no
message source is found, the `ApplicationContext` attempts to find a parent containing a
bean with the same name. If it does, it uses that bean as the `MessageSource`. If the
`ApplicationContext` cannot find any source for messages, an empty
`DelegatingMessageSource` is instantiated in order to be able to accept calls to the
methods defined above.

Spring provides three `MessageSource` implementations, `ResourceBundleMessageSource`, `ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource`
and `StaticMessageSource`. All of them implement `HierarchicalMessageSource` in order to do nested
messaging. The `StaticMessageSource` is rarely used but provides programmatic ways to
add messages to the source. The following example shows `ResourceBundleMessageSource`:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<beans>
		<bean id="messageSource"
				class="org.springframework.context.support.ResourceBundleMessageSource">
			<property name="basenames">
				<list>
					<value>format</value>
					<value>exceptions</value>
					<value>windows</value>
				</list>
			</property>
		</bean>
	</beans>
----

The example assumes that you have three resource bundles called `format`, `exceptions` and `windows`
defined in your classpath. Any request to resolve a message is
handled in the JDK-standard way of resolving messages through `ResourceBundle` objects. For the
purposes of the example, assume the contents of two of the above resource bundle files
are as follows:

[source,properties,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	# in format.properties
	message=Alligators rock!
----

[source,properties,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	# in exceptions.properties
	argument.required=The {0} argument is required.
----

The next example shows a program to run the `MessageSource` functionality.
Remember that all `ApplicationContext` implementations are also `MessageSource`
implementations and so can be cast to the `MessageSource` interface.

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		MessageSource resources = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");
		String message = resources.getMessage("message", null, "Default", Locale.ENGLISH);
		System.out.println(message);
	}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	fun main() {
		val resources = ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml")
		val message = resources.getMessage("message", null, "Default", Locale.ENGLISH)
		println(message)
	}
----
======

The resulting output from the above program is as follows:

[literal,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
Alligators rock!
----

To summarize, the `MessageSource` is defined in a file called `beans.xml`, which
exists at the root of your classpath. The `messageSource` bean definition refers to a
number of resource bundles through its `basenames` property. The three files that are
passed in the list to the `basenames` property exist as files at the root of your
classpath and are called `format.properties`, `exceptions.properties`, and
`windows.properties`, respectively.

The next example shows arguments passed to the message lookup. These arguments are
converted into `String` objects and inserted into placeholders in the lookup message.

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<beans>

		<!-- this MessageSource is being used in a web application -->
		<bean id="messageSource" class="org.springframework.context.support.ResourceBundleMessageSource">
			<property name="basename" value="exceptions"/>
		</bean>

		<!-- lets inject the above MessageSource into this POJO -->
		<bean id="example" class="com.something.Example">
			<property name="messages" ref="messageSource"/>
		</bean>

	</beans>
----

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class Example {

		private MessageSource messages;

		public void setMessages(MessageSource messages) {
			this.messages = messages;
		}

		public void execute() {
			String message = this.messages.getMessage("argument.required",
				new Object [] {"userDao"}, "Required", Locale.ENGLISH);
			System.out.println(message);
		}
	}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	class Example {

	lateinit var messages: MessageSource

	fun execute() {
		val message = messages.getMessage("argument.required",
				arrayOf("userDao"), "Required", Locale.ENGLISH)
		println(message)
	}
}
----
======

The resulting output from the invocation of the `execute()` method is as follows:

[literal,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
The userDao argument is required.
----

With regard to internationalization ("`i18n`"), Spring's various `MessageSource`
implementations follow the same locale resolution and fallback rules as the standard JDK
`ResourceBundle`. In short, and continuing with the example `messageSource` defined
previously, if you want to resolve messages against the British (`en-GB`) locale, you
would create files called `format_en_GB.properties`, `exceptions_en_GB.properties`, and
`windows_en_GB.properties`, respectively.

Typically, locale resolution is managed by the surrounding environment of the
application. In the following example, the locale against which (British) messages are
resolved is specified manually:

[literal,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
# in exceptions_en_GB.properties
argument.required=Ebagum lad, the ''{0}'' argument is required, I say, required.
----

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public static void main(final String[] args) {
		MessageSource resources = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");
		String message = resources.getMessage("argument.required",
			new Object [] {"userDao"}, "Required", Locale.UK);
		System.out.println(message);
	}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	fun main() {
		val resources = ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml")
		val message = resources.getMessage("argument.required",
				arrayOf("userDao"), "Required", Locale.UK)
		println(message)
	}
----
======

The resulting output from the running of the above program is as follows:

[literal,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
Ebagum lad, the 'userDao' argument is required, I say, required.
----

You can also use the `MessageSourceAware` interface to acquire a reference to any
`MessageSource` that has been defined. Any bean that is defined in an
`ApplicationContext` that implements the `MessageSourceAware` interface is injected with
the application context's `MessageSource` when the bean is created and configured.

NOTE: Because Spring's `MessageSource` is based on Java's `ResourceBundle`, it does not merge
bundles with the same base name, but will only use the first bundle found.
Subsequent message bundles with the same base name are ignored.

NOTE: As an alternative to `ResourceBundleMessageSource`, Spring provides a
`ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource` class. This variant supports the same bundle
file format but is more flexible than the standard JDK based
`ResourceBundleMessageSource` implementation. In particular, it allows for reading
files from any Spring resource location (not only from the classpath) and supports hot
reloading of bundle property files (while efficiently caching them in between).
See the {spring-framework-api}/context/support/ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource.html[`ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource`]
javadoc for details.



[[context-functionality-events]]
== Standard and Custom Events

Event handling in the `ApplicationContext` is provided through the `ApplicationEvent`
class and the `ApplicationListener` interface. If a bean that implements the
`ApplicationListener` interface is deployed into the context, every time an
`ApplicationEvent` gets published to the `ApplicationContext`, that bean is notified.
Essentially, this is the standard Observer design pattern.

TIP: As of Spring 4.2, the event infrastructure has been significantly improved and offers
an xref:core/beans/context-introduction.adoc#context-functionality-events-annotation[annotation-based model] as well as the
ability to publish any arbitrary event (that is, an object that does not necessarily
extend from `ApplicationEvent`). When such an object is published, we wrap it in an
event for you.

The following table describes the standard events that Spring provides:

[[beans-ctx-events-tbl]]
.Built-in Events
[cols="30%,70%"]
|===
| Event| Explanation

| `ContextRefreshedEvent`
| Published when the `ApplicationContext` is initialized or refreshed (for example, by
  using the `refresh()` method on the `ConfigurableApplicationContext` interface).
  Here, "`initialized`" means that all beans are loaded, post-processor beans are detected
  and activated, singletons are pre-instantiated, and the `ApplicationContext` object is
  ready for use. As long as the context has not been closed, a refresh can be triggered
  multiple times, provided that the chosen `ApplicationContext` actually supports such
  "`hot`" refreshes. For example, `XmlWebApplicationContext` supports hot refreshes, but
  `GenericApplicationContext` does not.

| `ContextStartedEvent`
| Published when the `ApplicationContext` is started by using the `start()` method on the
  `ConfigurableApplicationContext` interface. Here, "`started`" means that all `Lifecycle`
  beans receive an explicit start signal. Typically, this signal is used to restart beans
  after an explicit stop, but it may also be used to start components that have not been
  configured for autostart (for example, components that have not already started on
  initialization).

| `ContextStoppedEvent`
| Published when the `ApplicationContext` is stopped by using the `stop()` method on the
  `ConfigurableApplicationContext` interface. Here, "`stopped`" means that all `Lifecycle`
  beans receive an explicit stop signal. A stopped context may be restarted through a
  `start()` call.

| `ContextClosedEvent`
| Published when the `ApplicationContext` is being closed by using the `close()` method
  on the `ConfigurableApplicationContext` interface or via a JVM shutdown hook. Here,
  "closed" means that all singleton beans will be destroyed. Once the context is closed,
  it reaches its end of life and cannot be refreshed or restarted.

| `RequestHandledEvent`
| A web-specific event telling all beans that an HTTP request has been serviced. This
  event is published after the request is complete. This event is only applicable to
  web applications that use Spring's `DispatcherServlet`.

| `ServletRequestHandledEvent`
| A subclass of `RequestHandledEvent` that adds Servlet-specific context information.

|===

You can also create and publish your own custom events. The following example shows a
simple class that extends Spring's `ApplicationEvent` base class:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class BlockedListEvent extends ApplicationEvent {

		private final String address;
		private final String content;

		public BlockedListEvent(Object source, String address, String content) {
			super(source);
			this.address = address;
			this.content = content;
		}

		// accessor and other methods...
	}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	class BlockedListEvent(source: Any,
						val address: String,
						val content: String) : ApplicationEvent(source)
----
======

To publish a custom `ApplicationEvent`, call the `publishEvent()` method on an
`ApplicationEventPublisher`. Typically, this is done by creating a class that implements
`ApplicationEventPublisherAware` and registering it as a Spring bean. The following
example shows such a class:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class EmailService implements ApplicationEventPublisherAware {

		private List<String> blockedList;
		private ApplicationEventPublisher publisher;

		public void setBlockedList(List<String> blockedList) {
			this.blockedList = blockedList;
		}

		public void setApplicationEventPublisher(ApplicationEventPublisher publisher) {
			this.publisher = publisher;
		}

		public void sendEmail(String address, String content) {
			if (blockedList.contains(address)) {
				publisher.publishEvent(new BlockedListEvent(this, address, content));
				return;
			}
			// send email...
		}
	}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	class EmailService : ApplicationEventPublisherAware {

		private lateinit var blockedList: List<String>
		private lateinit var publisher: ApplicationEventPublisher

		fun setBlockedList(blockedList: List<String>) {
			this.blockedList = blockedList
		}

		override fun setApplicationEventPublisher(publisher: ApplicationEventPublisher) {
			this.publisher = publisher
		}

		fun sendEmail(address: String, content: String) {
			if (blockedList!!.contains(address)) {
				publisher!!.publishEvent(BlockedListEvent(this, address, content))
				return
			}
			// send email...
		}
	}
----
======

At configuration time, the Spring container detects that `EmailService` implements
`ApplicationEventPublisherAware` and automatically calls
`setApplicationEventPublisher()`. In reality, the parameter passed in is the Spring
container itself. You are interacting with the application context through its
`ApplicationEventPublisher` interface.

To receive the custom `ApplicationEvent`, you can create a class that implements
`ApplicationListener` and register it as a Spring bean. The following example
shows such a class:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class BlockedListNotifier implements ApplicationListener<BlockedListEvent> {

		private String notificationAddress;

		public void setNotificationAddress(String notificationAddress) {
			this.notificationAddress = notificationAddress;
		}

		public void onApplicationEvent(BlockedListEvent event) {
			// notify appropriate parties via notificationAddress...
		}
	}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	class BlockedListNotifier : ApplicationListener<BlockedListEvent> {

		lateinit var notificationAddress: String

		override fun onApplicationEvent(event: BlockedListEvent) {
			// notify appropriate parties via notificationAddress...
		}
	}
----
======

Notice that `ApplicationListener` is generically parameterized with the type of your custom event (`BlockedListEvent` in the preceding example).
This means that the `onApplicationEvent()` method can remain type-safe, avoiding any need for downcasting.
You can register as many event listeners as you wish, but note that, by default, event listeners receive events synchronously.
This means that the `publishEvent()` method blocks until all listeners have finished processing the event.
One advantage of this synchronous and single-threaded approach is that, when a listener receives an event,
it operates inside the transaction context of the publisher if a transaction context is available.
If another strategy for event publication becomes necessary, for example, asynchronous event processing by default,
see the javadoc for Spring's {spring-framework-api}/context/event/ApplicationEventMulticaster.html[`ApplicationEventMulticaster`] interface
and {spring-framework-api}/context/event/SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster.html[`SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster`] implementation
for configuration options which can be applied to a custom "applicationEventMulticaster" bean definition.
In these cases, ThreadLocals and logging context are not propagated for the event processing.
See xref:integration/observability.adoc#observability.application-events[the `@EventListener` Observability section]
for more information on Observability concerns.



The following example shows the bean definitions used to register and configure each of
the classes above:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="emailService" class="example.EmailService">
		<property name="blockedList">
			<list>
				<value>known.spammer@example.org</value>
				<value>known.hacker@example.org</value>
				<value>john.doe@example.org</value>
			</list>
		</property>
	</bean>

	<bean id="blockedListNotifier" class="example.BlockedListNotifier">
		<property name="notificationAddress" value="blockedlist@example.org"/>
	</bean>

	<!-- optional: a custom ApplicationEventMulticaster definition -->
	<bean id="applicationEventMulticaster" class="org.springframework.context.event.SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster">
		<property name="taskExecutor" ref="..."/>
		<property name="errorHandler" ref="..."/>
	</bean>
----

Putting it all together, when the `sendEmail()` method of the `emailService` bean is
called, if there are any email messages that should be blocked, a custom event of type
`BlockedListEvent` is published. The `blockedListNotifier` bean is registered as an
`ApplicationListener` and receives the `BlockedListEvent`, at which point it can
notify appropriate parties.

NOTE: Spring's eventing mechanism is designed for simple communication between Spring beans
within the same application context. However, for more sophisticated enterprise
integration needs, the separately maintained
{spring-site-projects}/spring-integration/[Spring Integration] project provides
complete support for building lightweight,
https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com[pattern-oriented], event-driven
architectures that build upon the well-known Spring programming model.


[[context-functionality-events-annotation]]
=== Annotation-based Event Listeners

You can register an event listener on any method of a managed bean by using the
`@EventListener` annotation. The `BlockedListNotifier` can be rewritten as follows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class BlockedListNotifier {

		private String notificationAddress;

		public void setNotificationAddress(String notificationAddress) {
			this.notificationAddress = notificationAddress;
		}

		@EventListener
		public void processBlockedListEvent(BlockedListEvent event) {
			// notify appropriate parties via notificationAddress...
		}
	}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	class BlockedListNotifier {

		lateinit var notificationAddress: String

		@EventListener
		fun processBlockedListEvent(event: BlockedListEvent) {
			// notify appropriate parties via notificationAddress...
		}
	}
----
======

NOTE: Do not define such beans to be lazy as the `ApplicationContext` will honour that and will not register the method to listen to events.

The method signature once again declares the event type to which it listens,
but, this time, with a flexible name and without implementing a specific listener interface.
The event type can also be narrowed through generics as long as the actual event type
resolves your generic parameter in its implementation hierarchy.

If your method should listen to several events or if you want to define it with no
parameter at all, the event types can also be specified on the annotation itself. The
following example shows how to do so:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@EventListener({ContextStartedEvent.class, ContextRefreshedEvent.class})
	public void handleContextStart() {
		// ...
	}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@EventListener(ContextStartedEvent::class, ContextRefreshedEvent::class)
	fun handleContextStart() {
		// ...
	}
----
======

It is also possible to add additional runtime filtering by using the `condition` attribute
of the annotation that defines a xref:core/expressions.adoc[`SpEL` expression], which should match
to actually invoke the method for a particular event.

The following example shows how our notifier can be rewritten to be invoked only if the
`content` attribute of the event is equal to `my-event`:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@EventListener(condition = "#blEvent.content == 'my-event'")
	public void processBlockedListEvent(BlockedListEvent blEvent) {
		// notify appropriate parties via notificationAddress...
	}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@EventListener(condition = "#blEvent.content == 'my-event'")
	fun processBlockedListEvent(blEvent: BlockedListEvent) {
		// notify appropriate parties via notificationAddress...
	}
----
======

Each `SpEL` expression evaluates against a dedicated context. The following table lists the
items made available to the context so that you can use them for conditional event processing:

[[context-functionality-events-annotation-tbl]]
.Event metadata available in SpEL expressions
|===
| Name| Location| Description| Example

| Event
| root object
| The actual `ApplicationEvent`.
| `#root.event` or `event`

| Arguments array
| root object
| The arguments (as an object array) used to invoke the method.
| `#root.args` or `args`; `args[0]` to access the first argument, etc.

| __Argument name__
| evaluation context
| The name of a particular method argument. If the names are not available
  (for example, because the code was compiled without the `-parameters` flag), individual
  arguments are also available using the `#a<#arg>` syntax where `<#arg>` stands for the
  argument index (starting from 0).
| `#blEvent` or `#a0` (you can also use `#p0` or `#p<#arg>` parameter notation as an alias)
|===

Note that `#root.event` gives you access to the underlying event, even if your method
signature actually refers to an arbitrary object that was published.

If you need to publish an event as the result of processing another event, you can change the
method signature to return the event that should be published, as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@EventListener
	public ListUpdateEvent handleBlockedListEvent(BlockedListEvent event) {
		// notify appropriate parties via notificationAddress and
		// then publish a ListUpdateEvent...
	}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@EventListener
	fun handleBlockedListEvent(event: BlockedListEvent): ListUpdateEvent {
		// notify appropriate parties via notificationAddress and
		// then publish a ListUpdateEvent...
	}
----
======

NOTE: This feature is not supported for
xref:core/beans/context-introduction.adoc#context-functionality-events-async[asynchronous listeners].

The `handleBlockedListEvent()` method publishes a new `ListUpdateEvent` for every
`BlockedListEvent` that it handles. If you need to publish several events, you can return
a `Collection` or an array of events instead.


[[context-functionality-events-async]]
=== Asynchronous Listeners

If you want a particular listener to process events asynchronously, you can reuse the
xref:integration/scheduling.adoc#scheduling-annotation-support-async[regular `@Async` support].
The following example shows how to do so:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@EventListener
	@Async
	public void processBlockedListEvent(BlockedListEvent event) {
		// BlockedListEvent is processed in a separate thread
	}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@EventListener
	@Async
	fun processBlockedListEvent(event: BlockedListEvent) {
		// BlockedListEvent is processed in a separate thread
	}
----
======

Be aware of the following limitations when using asynchronous events:

* If an asynchronous event listener throws an `Exception`, it is not propagated to the
  caller. See
  {spring-framework-api}/aop/interceptor/AsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler.html[`AsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler`]
  for more details.
* Asynchronous event listener methods cannot publish a subsequent event by returning a
  value. If you need to publish another event as the result of the processing, inject an
  {spring-framework-api}/context/ApplicationEventPublisher.html[`ApplicationEventPublisher`]
  to publish the event manually.
* ThreadLocals and logging context are not propagated by default for the event processing.
  See xref:integration/observability.adoc#observability.application-events[the `@EventListener` Observability section]
  for more information on Observability concerns.


[[context-functionality-events-order]]
=== Ordering Listeners

If you need one listener to be invoked before another one, you can add the `@Order`
annotation to the method declaration, as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@EventListener
	@Order(42)
	public void processBlockedListEvent(BlockedListEvent event) {
		// notify appropriate parties via notificationAddress...
	}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@EventListener
	@Order(42)
	fun processBlockedListEvent(event: BlockedListEvent) {
		// notify appropriate parties via notificationAddress...
	}
----
======


[[context-functionality-events-generics]]
=== Generic Events

You can also use generics to further define the structure of your event. Consider using an
`EntityCreatedEvent<T>` where `T` is the type of the actual entity that got created. For example, you
can create the following listener definition to receive only `EntityCreatedEvent` for a
`Person`:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@EventListener
	public void onPersonCreated(EntityCreatedEvent<Person> event) {
		// ...
	}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@EventListener
	fun onPersonCreated(event: EntityCreatedEvent<Person>) {
		// ...
	}
----
======

Due to type erasure, this works only if the event that is fired resolves the generic
parameters on which the event listener filters (that is, something like
`class PersonCreatedEvent extends EntityCreatedEvent<Person> { ... }`).

In certain circumstances, this may become quite tedious if all events follow the same
structure (as should be the case for the event in the preceding example). In such a case,
you can implement `ResolvableTypeProvider` to guide the framework beyond what the runtime
environment provides. The following event shows how to do so:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class EntityCreatedEvent<T> extends ApplicationEvent implements ResolvableTypeProvider {

		public EntityCreatedEvent(T entity) {
			super(entity);
		}

		@Override
		public ResolvableType getResolvableType() {
			return ResolvableType.forClassWithGenerics(getClass(), ResolvableType.forInstance(getSource()));
		}
	}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	class EntityCreatedEvent<T>(entity: T) : ApplicationEvent(entity), ResolvableTypeProvider {

		override fun getResolvableType(): ResolvableType? {
			return ResolvableType.forClassWithGenerics(javaClass, ResolvableType.forInstance(getSource()))
		}
	}
----
======

TIP: This works not only for `ApplicationEvent` but any arbitrary object that you send as
an event.

Finally, as with classic `ApplicationListener` implementations, the actual multicasting
happens via a context-wide `ApplicationEventMulticaster` at runtime. By default, this is a
`SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster` with synchronous event publication in the caller thread.
This can be replaced/customized through an "applicationEventMulticaster" bean definition,
for example, for processing all events asynchronously and/or for handling listener exceptions:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Bean
	ApplicationEventMulticaster applicationEventMulticaster() {
		SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster multicaster = new SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster();
		multicaster.setTaskExecutor(...);
		multicaster.setErrorHandler(...);
		return multicaster;
	}

[[context-functionality-resources]]
== Convenient Access to Low-level Resources

For optimal usage and understanding of application contexts, you should familiarize
yourself with Spring's `Resource` abstraction, as described in
xref:core/resources.adoc[Resources].

An application context is a `ResourceLoader`, which can be used to load `Resource` objects.
A `Resource` is essentially a more feature rich version of the JDK `java.net.URL` class.
In fact, implementations of `Resource` wrap an instance of `java.net.URL`, where
appropriate. A `Resource` can obtain low-level resources from almost any location in a
transparent fashion, including from the classpath, a filesystem location, anywhere
describable with a standard URL, and some other variations. If the resource location
string is a simple path without any special prefixes, where those resources come from is
specific and appropriate to the actual application context type.

You can configure a bean deployed into the application context to implement the special
callback interface, `ResourceLoaderAware`, to be automatically called back at
initialization time with the application context itself passed in as the `ResourceLoader`.
You can also expose properties of type `Resource`, to be used to access static resources.
They are injected into it like any other properties. You can specify those `Resource`
properties as simple `String` paths and rely on automatic conversion from those text
strings to actual `Resource` objects when the bean is deployed.

The location path or paths supplied to an `ApplicationContext` constructor are actually
resource strings and, in simple form, are treated appropriately according to the specific
context implementation. For example `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` treats a simple
location path as a classpath location. You can also use location paths (resource strings)
with special prefixes to force loading of definitions from the classpath or a URL,
regardless of the actual context type.



[[context-functionality-startup]]
== Application Startup Tracking

The `ApplicationContext` manages the lifecycle of Spring applications and provides a rich
programming model around components. As a result, complex applications can have equally
complex component graphs and startup phases.

Tracking the application startup steps with specific metrics can help understand where
time is being spent during the startup phase, but it can also be used as a way to better
understand the context lifecycle as a whole.

The `AbstractApplicationContext` (and its subclasses) is instrumented with an
`ApplicationStartup`, which collects `StartupStep` data about various startup phases:

* application context lifecycle (base packages scanning, config classes management)
* beans lifecycle (instantiation, smart initialization, post processing)
* application events processing

Here is an example of instrumentation in the `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext`:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	// create a startup step and start recording
	StartupStep scanPackages = getApplicationStartup().start("spring.context.base-packages.scan");
	// add tagging information to the current step
	scanPackages.tag("packages", () -> Arrays.toString(basePackages));
	// perform the actual phase we're instrumenting
	this.scanner.scan(basePackages);
	// end the current step
	scanPackages.end();
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	// create a startup step and start recording
	val scanPackages = getApplicationStartup().start("spring.context.base-packages.scan")
	// add tagging information to the current step
	scanPackages.tag("packages", () -> Arrays.toString(basePackages))
	// perform the actual phase we're instrumenting
	this.scanner.scan(basePackages)
	// end the current step
	scanPackages.end()
----
======

The application context is already instrumented with multiple steps.
Once recorded, these startup steps can be collected, displayed and analyzed with specific tools.
For a complete list of existing startup steps, you can check out the
xref:core/appendix/application-startup-steps.adoc[dedicated appendix section].

The default `ApplicationStartup` implementation is a no-op variant, for minimal overhead.
This means no metrics will be collected during application startup by default.
Spring Framework ships with an implementation for tracking startup steps with Java Flight Recorder:
`FlightRecorderApplicationStartup`. To use this variant, you must configure an instance of it
to the `ApplicationContext` as soon as it's been created.

Developers can also use the `ApplicationStartup` infrastructure if they're providing their own
`AbstractApplicationContext` subclass, or if they wish to collect more precise data.

WARNING: `ApplicationStartup` is meant to be only used during application startup and for
the core container; this is by no means a replacement for Java profilers or
metrics libraries like https://micrometer.io[Micrometer].

To start collecting custom `StartupStep`, components can either get the `ApplicationStartup`
instance from the application context directly, make their component implement `ApplicationStartupAware`,
or ask for the `ApplicationStartup` type on any injection point.

NOTE: Developers should not use the `"spring.*"` namespace when creating custom startup steps.
This namespace is reserved for internal Spring usage and is subject to change.

[[context-create]]
== Convenient ApplicationContext Instantiation for Web Applications

You can create `ApplicationContext` instances declaratively by using, for example, a
`ContextLoader`. Of course, you can also create `ApplicationContext` instances
programmatically by using one of the `ApplicationContext` implementations.

You can register an `ApplicationContext` by using the `ContextLoaderListener`, as the
following example shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<context-param>
		<param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
		<param-value>/WEB-INF/daoContext.xml /WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml</param-value>
	</context-param>

	<listener>
		<listener-class>org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener</listener-class>
	</listener>
----

The listener inspects the `contextConfigLocation` parameter. If the parameter does not
exist, the listener uses `/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml` as a default. When the
parameter does exist, the listener separates the `String` by using predefined
delimiters (comma, semicolon, and whitespace) and uses the values as locations where
application contexts are searched. Ant-style path patterns are supported as well.
Examples are `/WEB-INF/{asterisk}Context.xml` (for all files with names that end with
`Context.xml` and that reside in the `WEB-INF` directory) and `/WEB-INF/**/*Context.xml`
(for all such files in any subdirectory of `WEB-INF`).



[[context-deploy-rar]]
== Deploying a Spring `ApplicationContext` as a Jakarta EE RAR File

It is possible to deploy a Spring `ApplicationContext` as a RAR file, encapsulating the
context and all of its required bean classes and library JARs in a Jakarta EE RAR deployment
unit. This is the equivalent of bootstrapping a stand-alone `ApplicationContext` (only hosted
in Jakarta EE environment) being able to access the Jakarta EE servers facilities. RAR deployment
is a more natural alternative to a scenario of deploying a headless WAR file -- in effect,
a WAR file without any HTTP entry points that is used only for bootstrapping a Spring
`ApplicationContext` in a Jakarta EE environment.

RAR deployment is ideal for application contexts that do not need HTTP entry points but
rather consist only of message endpoints and scheduled jobs. Beans in such a context can
use application server resources such as the JTA transaction manager and JNDI-bound JDBC
`DataSource` instances and JMS `ConnectionFactory` instances and can also register with
the platform's JMX server -- all through Spring's standard transaction management and JNDI
and JMX support facilities. Application components can also interact with the application
server's JCA `WorkManager` through Spring's `TaskExecutor` abstraction.

See the javadoc of the
{spring-framework-api}/jca/context/SpringContextResourceAdapter.html[`SpringContextResourceAdapter`]
class for the configuration details involved in RAR deployment.

For a simple deployment of a Spring ApplicationContext as a Jakarta EE RAR file:

. Package
all application classes into a RAR file (which is a standard JAR file with a different
file extension).
. Add all required library JARs into the root of the RAR archive.
. Add a
`META-INF/ra.xml` deployment descriptor (as shown in the {spring-framework-api}/jca/context/SpringContextResourceAdapter.html[javadoc for `SpringContextResourceAdapter`])
and the corresponding Spring XML bean definition file(s) (typically
`META-INF/applicationContext.xml`).
. Drop the resulting RAR file into your
application server's deployment directory.

NOTE: Such RAR deployment units are usually self-contained. They do not expose components
to the outside world, not even to other modules of the same application. Interaction with a
RAR-based `ApplicationContext` usually occurs through JMS destinations that it shares with
other modules. A RAR-based `ApplicationContext` may also, for example, schedule some jobs
or react to new files in the file system (or the like). If it needs to allow synchronous
access from the outside, it could (for example) export RMI endpoints, which may be used
by other application modules on the same machine.
