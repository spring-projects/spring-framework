= Container Extension Points

Typically, an application developer does not need to subclass `ApplicationContext`
implementation classes. Instead, the Spring IoC container can be extended by plugging in
implementations of special integration interfaces. The next few sections describe these
integration interfaces.



[[beans-factory-extension-bpp]]
== Customizing Beans by Using a `BeanPostProcessor`

The `BeanPostProcessor` interface defines callback methods that you can implement to
provide your own (or override the container's default) instantiation logic, dependency
resolution logic, and so forth. If you want to implement some custom logic after the
Spring container finishes instantiating, configuring, and initializing a bean, you can
plug in one or more custom `BeanPostProcessor` implementations.

You can configure multiple `BeanPostProcessor` instances, and you can control the order
in which these `BeanPostProcessor` instances run by setting the `order` property.
You can set this property only if the `BeanPostProcessor` implements the `Ordered`
interface. If you write your own `BeanPostProcessor`, you should consider implementing
the `Ordered` interface, too. For further details, see the javadoc of the
{spring-framework-api}/beans/factory/config/BeanPostProcessor.html[`BeanPostProcessor`]
and {spring-framework-api}/core/Ordered.html[`Ordered`] interfaces. See also the note on
xref:core/beans/factory-extension.adoc#beans-factory-programmatically-registering-beanpostprocessors[programmatic registration of `BeanPostProcessor` instances].

[NOTE]
====
`BeanPostProcessor` instances operate on bean (or object) instances. That is,
the Spring IoC container instantiates a bean instance and then `BeanPostProcessor`
instances do their work.

`BeanPostProcessor` instances are scoped per-container. This is relevant only if you
use container hierarchies. If you define a `BeanPostProcessor` in one container,
it post-processes only the beans in that container. In other words, beans that are
defined in one container are not post-processed by a `BeanPostProcessor` defined in
another container, even if both containers are part of the same hierarchy.

To change the actual bean definition (that is, the blueprint that defines the bean),
you instead need to use a `BeanFactoryPostProcessor`, as described in
xref:core/beans/factory-extension.adoc#beans-factory-extension-factory-postprocessors[Customizing Configuration Metadata with a `BeanFactoryPostProcessor`].
====

The `org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanPostProcessor` interface consists of
exactly two callback methods. When such a class is registered as a post-processor with
the container, for each bean instance that is created by the container, the
post-processor gets a callback from the container both before container
initialization methods (such as `InitializingBean.afterPropertiesSet()` or any
declared `init` method) are called, and after any bean initialization callbacks.
The post-processor can take any action with the bean instance, including ignoring the
callback completely. A bean post-processor typically checks for callback interfaces,
or it may wrap a bean with a proxy. Some Spring AOP infrastructure classes are
implemented as bean post-processors in order to provide proxy-wrapping logic.

An `ApplicationContext` automatically detects any beans that are defined in the
configuration metadata that implement the `BeanPostProcessor` interface. The
`ApplicationContext` registers these beans as post-processors so that they can be called
later, upon bean creation. Bean post-processors can be deployed in the container in the
same fashion as any other beans.

Note that, when declaring a `BeanPostProcessor` by using an `@Bean` factory method on a
configuration class, the return type of the factory method should be the implementation
class itself or at least the `org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanPostProcessor`
interface, clearly indicating the post-processor nature of that bean. Otherwise, the
`ApplicationContext` cannot autodetect it by type before fully creating it.
Since a `BeanPostProcessor` needs to be instantiated early in order to apply to the
initialization of other beans in the context, this early type detection is critical.

[[beans-factory-programmatically-registering-beanpostprocessors]]
.Programmatically registering `BeanPostProcessor` instances
NOTE: While the recommended approach for `BeanPostProcessor` registration is through
`ApplicationContext` auto-detection (as described earlier), you can register them
programmatically against a `ConfigurableBeanFactory` by using the `addBeanPostProcessor`
method. This can be useful when you need to evaluate conditional logic before
registration or even for copying bean post processors across contexts in a hierarchy.
Note, however, that `BeanPostProcessor` instances added programmatically do not respect
the `Ordered` interface. Here, it is the order of registration that dictates the order
of execution. Note also that `BeanPostProcessor` instances registered programmatically
are always processed before those registered through auto-detection, regardless of any
explicit ordering.

.`BeanPostProcessor` instances and AOP auto-proxying
[NOTE]
====
Classes that implement the `BeanPostProcessor` interface are special and are treated
differently by the container. All `BeanPostProcessor` instances and beans that they
directly reference are instantiated on startup, as part of the special startup phase
of the `ApplicationContext`. Next, all `BeanPostProcessor` instances are registered
in a sorted fashion and applied to all further beans in the container. Because AOP
auto-proxying is implemented as a `BeanPostProcessor` itself, neither `BeanPostProcessor`
instances nor the beans they directly reference are eligible for auto-proxying and,
thus, do not have aspects woven into them.

For any such bean, you should see an informational log message: `Bean someBean is not
eligible for getting processed by all BeanPostProcessor interfaces (for example: not
eligible for auto-proxying)`.

If you have beans wired into your `BeanPostProcessor` by using autowiring or
`@Resource` (which may fall back to autowiring), Spring might access unexpected beans
when searching for type-matching dependency candidates and, therefore, make them
ineligible for auto-proxying or other kinds of bean post-processing. For example, if you
have a dependency annotated with `@Resource` where the field or setter name does not
directly correspond to the declared name of a bean and no name attribute is used,
Spring accesses other beans for matching them by type.
====

The following examples show how to write, register, and use `BeanPostProcessor` instances
in an `ApplicationContext`.


[[beans-factory-extension-bpp-examples-hw]]
=== Example: Hello World, `BeanPostProcessor`-style

This first example illustrates basic usage. The example shows a custom
`BeanPostProcessor` implementation that invokes the `toString()` method of each bean as
it is created by the container and prints the resulting string to the system console.

The following listing shows the custom `BeanPostProcessor` implementation class definition:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",chomp="-packages"]
----
	package scripting;

	import org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanPostProcessor;

	public class InstantiationTracingBeanPostProcessor implements BeanPostProcessor {

		// simply return the instantiated bean as-is
		public Object postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) {
			return bean; // we could potentially return any object reference here...
		}

		public Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) {
			System.out.println("Bean '" + beanName + "' created : " + bean.toString());
			return bean;
		}
	}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",chomp="-packages"]
----
	package scripting

	import org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanPostProcessor

	class InstantiationTracingBeanPostProcessor : BeanPostProcessor {

		// simply return the instantiated bean as-is
		override fun postProcessBeforeInitialization(bean: Any, beanName: String): Any? {
			return bean // we could potentially return any object reference here...
		}

		override fun postProcessAfterInitialization(bean: Any, beanName: String): Any? {
			println("Bean '$beanName' created : $bean")
			return bean
		}
	}
----
======

The following `beans` element uses the `InstantiationTracingBeanPostProcessor`:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
		xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
		xmlns:lang="http://www.springframework.org/schema/lang"
		xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
			https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/lang
			https://www.springframework.org/schema/lang/spring-lang.xsd">

		<lang:groovy id="messenger"
				script-source="classpath:org/springframework/scripting/groovy/Messenger.groovy">
			<lang:property name="message" value="Fiona Apple Is Just So Dreamy."/>
		</lang:groovy>

		<!--
		when the above bean (messenger) is instantiated, this custom
		BeanPostProcessor implementation will output the fact to the system console
		-->
		<bean class="scripting.InstantiationTracingBeanPostProcessor"/>

	</beans>
----

Notice how the `InstantiationTracingBeanPostProcessor` is merely defined. It does not
even have a name, and, because it is a bean, it can be dependency-injected as you would any
other bean. (The preceding configuration also defines a bean that is backed by a Groovy
script. The Spring dynamic language support is detailed in the chapter entitled
xref:languages/dynamic.adoc[Dynamic Language Support].)

The following Java application runs the preceding code and configuration:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
	import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;
	import org.springframework.scripting.Messenger;

	public final class Boot {

		public static void main(final String[] args) throws Exception {
			ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("scripting/beans.xml");
			Messenger messenger = ctx.getBean("messenger", Messenger.class);
			System.out.println(messenger);
		}

	}
----

Kotlin::

[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	import org.springframework.beans.factory.getBean

	fun main() {
		val ctx = ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("scripting/beans.xml")
		val messenger = ctx.getBean<Messenger>("messenger")
		println(messenger)
	}
----
======

The output of the preceding application resembles the following:

[[beans-factory-extension-bpp-examples-aabpp]]
=== Example: The `AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor`

Using callback interfaces or annotations in conjunction with a custom `BeanPostProcessor`
implementation is a common means of extending the Spring IoC container. An example is
Spring's `AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor` -- a `BeanPostProcessor` implementation
that ships with the Spring distribution and autowires annotated fields, setter methods,
and arbitrary config methods.



[[beans-factory-extension-factory-postprocessors]]
== Customizing Configuration Metadata with a `BeanFactoryPostProcessor`

The next extension point that we look at is the
`org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanFactoryPostProcessor`. The semantics of
this interface are similar to those of the `BeanPostProcessor`, with one major
difference: `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` operates on the bean configuration metadata.
That is, the Spring IoC container lets a `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` read the
configuration metadata and potentially change it _before_ the container instantiates
any beans other than `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` instances.

You can configure multiple `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` instances, and you can control the order in
which these `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` instances run by setting the `order` property.
However, you can only set this property if the `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` implements the
`Ordered` interface. If you write your own `BeanFactoryPostProcessor`, you should
consider implementing the `Ordered` interface, too. See the javadoc of the
{spring-framework-api}/beans/factory/config/BeanFactoryPostProcessor.html[`BeanFactoryPostProcessor`]
and {spring-framework-api}/core/Ordered.html[`Ordered`] interfaces for more details.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to change the actual bean instances (that is, the objects that are created
from the configuration metadata), then you instead need to use a `BeanPostProcessor`
(described earlier in
xref:core/beans/factory-extension.adoc#beans-factory-extension-bpp[Customizing Beans by Using a `BeanPostProcessor`]).
While it is technically possible to work with bean instances within a `BeanFactoryPostProcessor`
(for example, by using `BeanFactory.getBean()`), doing so causes premature bean instantiation,
violating the standard container lifecycle. This may cause negative side effects, such as
bypassing bean post processing.

Also, `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` instances are scoped per-container. This is only relevant
if you use container hierarchies. If you define a `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` in one
container, it is applied only to the bean definitions in that container. Bean definitions
in one container are not post-processed by `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` instances in another
container, even if both containers are part of the same hierarchy.
====

A bean factory post-processor is automatically run when it is declared inside an
`ApplicationContext`, in order to apply changes to the configuration metadata that
define the container. Spring includes a number of predefined bean factory
post-processors, such as `PropertyOverrideConfigurer` and
`PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer`. You can also use a custom `BeanFactoryPostProcessor`
-- for example, to register custom property editors.

An `ApplicationContext` automatically detects any beans that are deployed into it that
implement the `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` interface. It uses these beans as bean factory
post-processors, at the appropriate time. You can deploy these post-processor beans as
you would any other bean.

NOTE: As with ``BeanPostProcessor``s , you typically do not want to configure
``BeanFactoryPostProcessor``s for lazy initialization. If no other bean references a
`Bean(Factory)PostProcessor`, that post-processor will not get instantiated at all.
Thus, marking it for lazy initialization will be ignored, and the
`Bean(Factory)PostProcessor` will be instantiated eagerly even if you set the
`default-lazy-init` attribute to `true` on the declaration of your `<beans />` element.


[[beans-factory-placeholderconfigurer]]
=== Example: Property Placeholder Substitution with `PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer`

You can use the `PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer` to externalize property values
from a bean definition in a separate file by using the standard Java `Properties` format.
Doing so enables the person deploying an application to customize environment-specific
properties, such as database URLs and passwords, without the complexity or risk of
modifying the main XML definition file or files for the container.

Consider the following XML-based configuration metadata fragment, where a `DataSource`
with placeholder values is defined:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean class="org.springframework.context.support.PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer">
		<property name="locations" value="classpath:com/something/jdbc.properties"/>
	</bean>

	<bean id="dataSource" class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource" destroy-method="close">
		<property name="driverClassName" value="${jdbc.driverClassName}"/>
		<property name="url" value="${jdbc.url}"/>
		<property name="username" value="${jdbc.username}"/>
		<property name="password" value="${jdbc.password}"/>
	</bean>
----

The example shows properties configured from an external `Properties` file. At runtime,
a `PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer` is applied to the metadata that replaces some
properties of the `DataSource`. The values to replace are specified as placeholders of the
form pass:q[`${property-name}`], which follows the Ant, log4j, and JSP EL style.

The actual values come from another file in the standard Java `Properties` format:

[literal,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
jdbc.driverClassName=org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
jdbc.url=jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://production:9002
jdbc.username=sa
jdbc.password=root
----

Therefore, the `${jdbc.username}` string is replaced at runtime with the value, 'sa', and
the same applies for other placeholder values that match keys in the properties file. The
`PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer` checks for placeholders in most properties and
attributes of a bean definition. Furthermore, you can customize the placeholder prefix,
suffix, default value separator, and escape character. In addition, the default escape
character can be changed or disabled globally by setting the
`spring.placeholder.escapeCharacter.default` property via a JVM system property (or via
the xref:appendix.adoc#appendix-spring-properties[`SpringProperties`] mechanism).

With the `context` namespace, you can configure property placeholders
with a dedicated configuration element. You can provide one or more locations as a
comma-separated list in the `location` attribute, as the following example shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<context:property-placeholder location="classpath:com/something/jdbc.properties"/>
----

The `PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer` not only looks for properties in the `Properties`
file you specify. By default, if it cannot find a property in the specified properties files,
it checks against Spring `Environment` properties and regular Java `System` properties.

[WARNING]
=====
Only one such element should be defined for a given application with the properties
that it needs. Several property placeholders can be configured as long as they have distinct
placeholder syntax (`${...}`).

If you need to modularize the source of properties used for the replacement, you should
not create multiple properties placeholders. Rather, you should create your own
`PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer` bean that gathers the properties to use.
=====

[TIP]
=====
You can use the `PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer` to substitute class names, which
is sometimes useful when you have to pick a particular implementation class at runtime.
The following example shows how to do so:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer">
		<property name="locations">
			<value>classpath:com/something/strategy.properties</value>
		</property>
		<property name="properties">
			<value>custom.strategy.class=com.something.DefaultStrategy</value>
		</property>
	</bean>

	<bean id="serviceStrategy" class="${custom.strategy.class}"/>
----

If the class cannot be resolved at runtime to a valid class, resolution of the bean
fails when it is about to be created, which is during the `preInstantiateSingletons()`
phase of an `ApplicationContext` for a non-lazy-init bean.
=====


[[beans-factory-overrideconfigurer]]
=== Example: The `PropertyOverrideConfigurer`

The `PropertyOverrideConfigurer`, another bean factory post-processor, resembles the
`PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer`, but unlike the latter, the original definitions
can have default values or no values at all for bean properties. If an overriding
`Properties` file does not have an entry for a certain bean property, the default
context definition is used.

Note that the bean definition is not aware of being overridden, so it is not
immediately obvious from the XML definition file that the override configurer is being
used. In case of multiple `PropertyOverrideConfigurer` instances that define different
values for the same bean property, the last one wins, due to the overriding mechanism.

Properties file configuration lines take the following format:

[literal,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
beanName.property=value
----

The following listing shows an example of the format:

[literal,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
dataSource.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
dataSource.url=jdbc:mysql:mydb
----

This example file can be used with a container definition that contains a bean called
`dataSource` that has `driverClassName` and `url` properties.

Compound property names are also supported, as long as every component of the path
except the final property being overridden is already non-null (presumably initialized
by the constructors). In the following example, the `sammy` property of the `bob`
property of the `fred` property of the `tom` bean is set to the scalar value `123`:

[literal,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
tom.fred.bob.sammy=123
----


NOTE: Specified override values are always literal values. They are not translated into
bean references. This convention also applies when the original value in the XML bean
definition specifies a bean reference.

With the `context` namespace introduced in Spring 2.5, it is possible to configure
property overriding with a dedicated configuration element, as the following example shows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<context:property-override location="classpath:override.properties"/>
----



[[beans-factory-extension-factorybean]]
== Customizing Instantiation Logic with a `FactoryBean`

You can implement the `org.springframework.beans.factory.FactoryBean` interface for objects that
are themselves factories.

The `FactoryBean` interface is a point of pluggability into the Spring IoC container's
instantiation logic. If you have complex initialization code that is better expressed in
Java as opposed to a (potentially) verbose amount of XML, you can create your own
`FactoryBean`, write the complex initialization inside that class, and then plug your
custom `FactoryBean` into the container.

The `FactoryBean<T>` interface provides three methods:

* `T getObject()`: Returns an instance of the object this factory creates. The
  instance can possibly be shared, depending on whether this factory returns singletons
  or prototypes.
* `boolean isSingleton()`: Returns `true` if this `FactoryBean` returns singletons or
  `false` otherwise. The default implementation of this method returns `true`.
* `Class<?> getObjectType()`: Returns the object type returned by the `getObject()` method
  or `null` if the type is not known in advance.

The `FactoryBean` concept and interface are used in a number of places within the Spring
Framework. More than 50 implementations of the `FactoryBean` interface ship with Spring
itself.

When you need to ask a container for an actual `FactoryBean` instance itself instead of
the bean it produces, prefix the bean's `id` with the ampersand symbol (`&`) when
calling the `getBean()` method of the `ApplicationContext`. So, for a given `FactoryBean`
with an `id` of `myBean`, invoking `getBean("myBean")` on the container returns the
product of the `FactoryBean`, whereas invoking `getBean("&myBean")` returns the
`FactoryBean` instance itself.
