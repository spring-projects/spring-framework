= Container Overview

The `org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext` interface represents the Spring IoC
container and is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling the beans.
The container gets its instructions on the components to instantiate, configure, and
assemble by reading configuration metadata. The configuration metadata can be represented
as annotated component classes, configuration classes with factory methods, or external
XML files or Groovy scripts. With either format, you may compose your application and the
rich interdependencies between those components.

Several implementations of the `ApplicationContext` interface are part of core Spring.
In stand-alone applications, it is common to create an instance of
{spring-framework-api}/context/annotation/AnnotationConfigApplicationContext.html[`AnnotationConfigApplicationContext`]
or {spring-framework-api}/context/support/ClassPathXmlApplicationContext.html[`ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`].

In most application scenarios, explicit user code is not required to instantiate one or
more instances of a Spring IoC container. For example, in a plain web application scenario,
a simple boilerplate web descriptor XML in the `web.xml` file of the application suffices (see
xref:core/beans/context-introduction.adoc#context-create[Convenient ApplicationContext Instantiation for Web Applications]).
In a Spring Boot scenario, the application context is implicitly bootstrapped for you
based on common setup conventions.

The following diagram shows a high-level view of how Spring works. Your application classes
are combined with configuration metadata so that, after the `ApplicationContext` is
created and initialized, you have a fully configured and executable system or application.

[[beans-factory-metadata]]
== Configuration Metadata

As the preceding diagram shows, the Spring IoC container consumes a form of
configuration metadata. This configuration metadata represents how you, as an
application developer, tell the Spring container to instantiate, configure,
and assemble the components in your application.

The Spring IoC container itself is totally decoupled from the format in which this
configuration metadata is actually written. These days, many developers choose
xref:core/beans/java.adoc[Java-based configuration] for their Spring applications:

* xref:core/beans/annotation-config.adoc[Annotation-based configuration]: define beans using
  annotation-based configuration metadata on your application's component classes.
* xref:core/beans/java.adoc[Java-based configuration]: define beans external to your application
  classes by using Java-based configuration classes. To use these features, see the
  {spring-framework-api}/context/annotation/Configuration.html[`@Configuration`],
  {spring-framework-api}/context/annotation/Bean.html[`@Bean`],
  {spring-framework-api}/context/annotation/Import.html[`@Import`],
  and {spring-framework-api}/context/annotation/DependsOn.html[`@DependsOn`] annotations.

Spring configuration consists of at least one and typically more than one bean definition
that the container must manage. Java configuration typically uses `@Bean`-annotated
methods within a `@Configuration` class, each corresponding to one bean definition.

These bean definitions correspond to the actual objects that make up your application.
Typically, you define service layer objects, persistence layer objects such as
repositories or data access objects (DAOs), presentation objects such as Web controllers,
infrastructure objects such as a JPA `EntityManagerFactory`, JMS queues, and so forth.
Typically, one does not configure fine-grained domain objects in the container, because
it is usually the responsibility of repositories and business logic to create and load
domain objects.



[[beans-factory-xml]]
=== XML as an External Configuration DSL

XML-based configuration metadata configures these beans as `<bean/>` elements inside
a top-level `<beans/>` element. The following example shows the basic structure of
XML-based configuration metadata:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
		xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
		xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
			https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

		<bean id="..." class="..."> <1> <2>
			<!-- collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
		</bean>

		<bean id="..." class="...">
			<!-- collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
		</bean>

		<!-- more bean definitions go here -->

	</beans>
----

<1> The `id` attribute is a string that identifies the individual bean definition.
<2> The `class` attribute defines the type of the bean and uses the fully qualified
class name.

The value of the `id` attribute can be used to refer to collaborating objects. The XML
for referring to collaborating objects is not shown in this example. See
xref:core/beans/dependencies.adoc[Dependencies] for more information.

For instantiating a container, the location path or paths to the XML resource files
need to be supplied to a `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` constructor that let the
container load configuration metadata from a variety of external resources, such
as the local file system, the Java `CLASSPATH`, and so on.

[tabs]

Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("services.xml", "daos.xml");
----

Kotlin::

[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	val context = ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("services.xml", "daos.xml")
----
======

[NOTE]
====
After you learn about Spring's IoC container, you may want to know more about Spring's
`Resource` abstraction (as described in
xref:core/resources.adoc[Resources])
which provides a convenient mechanism for reading an InputStream from locations defined
in a URI syntax. In particular, `Resource` paths are used to construct applications contexts,
as described in xref:core/resources.adoc#resources-app-ctx[Application Contexts and Resource Paths].
====

The following example shows the service layer objects `(services.xml)` configuration file:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
		xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
		xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
			https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

		<!-- services -->

		<bean id="petStore" class="org.springframework.samples.jpetstore.services.PetStoreServiceImpl">
			<property name="accountDao" ref="accountDao"/>
			<property name="itemDao" ref="itemDao"/>
			<!-- additional collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
		</bean>

		<!-- more bean definitions for services go here -->

	</beans>
----

The following example shows the data access objects `daos.xml` file:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
		xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
		xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
			https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

		<bean id="accountDao"
			class="org.springframework.samples.jpetstore.dao.jpa.JpaAccountDao">
			<!-- additional collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
		</bean>

		<bean id="itemDao" class="org.springframework.samples.jpetstore.dao.jpa.JpaItemDao">
			<!-- additional collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
		</bean>

		<!-- more bean definitions for data access objects go here -->

	</beans>
----

In the preceding example, the service layer consists of the `PetStoreServiceImpl` class
and two data access objects of the types `JpaAccountDao` and `JpaItemDao` (based
on the JPA Object-Relational Mapping standard). The `property name` element refers to the
name of the JavaBean property, and the `ref` element refers to the name of another bean
definition. This linkage between `id` and `ref` elements expresses the dependency between
collaborating objects. For details of configuring an object's dependencies, see
xref:core/beans/dependencies.adoc[Dependencies].


[[beans-factory-xml-import]]
=== Composing XML-based Configuration Metadata

It can be useful to have bean definitions span multiple XML files. Often, each individual
XML configuration file represents a logical layer or module in your architecture.

You can use the `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` constructor to load bean definitions from
XML fragments. This constructor takes multiple `Resource` locations, as was shown in the
xref:core/beans/basics.adoc#beans-factory-xml[previous section]. Alternatively,
use one or more occurrences of the `<import/>` element to load bean definitions from
another file or files. The following example shows how to do so:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<beans>
		<import resource="services.xml"/>
		<import resource="resources/messageSource.xml"/>

		<bean id="bean1" class="..."/>
		<bean id="bean2" class="..."/>
	</beans>
----

In the preceding example, external bean definitions are loaded from the files
`services.xml` and `messageSource.xml`. All location paths are
relative to the definition file doing the importing, so `services.xml` must be in the
same directory or classpath location as the file doing the importing, while
`messageSource.xml` must be in a `resources` location below the
location of the importing file. As you can see, a leading slash is ignored. However, given
that these paths are relative, it is better form not to use the slash at all. The
contents of the files being imported, including the top level `<beans/>` element, must
be valid XML bean definitions, according to the Spring Schema.

[NOTE]
====
It is possible, but not recommended, to reference files in parent directories using a
relative "../" path. Doing so creates a dependency on a file that is outside the current
application. In particular, this reference is not recommended for `classpath:` URLs (for
example, `classpath:../services.xml`), where the runtime resolution process chooses the
"`nearest`" classpath root and then looks into its parent directory. Classpath
configuration changes may lead to the choice of a different, incorrect directory.

You can always use fully qualified resource locations instead of relative paths: for
example, `file:C:/config/services.xml` or `classpath:/config/services.xml`. However, be
aware that you are coupling your application's configuration to specific absolute
locations. It is generally preferable to keep an indirection for such absolute
locations -- for example, through "${...}" placeholders that are resolved against JVM
system properties at runtime.
====

The namespace itself provides the import directive feature. Further
configuration features beyond plain bean definitions are available in a selection
of XML namespaces provided by Spring -- for example, the `context` and `util` namespaces.


[[beans-factory-groovy]]
=== The Groovy Bean Definition DSL

As a further example for externalized configuration metadata, bean definitions can also
be expressed in Spring's Groovy Bean Definition DSL, as known from the Grails framework.
Typically, such configuration live in a ".groovy" file with the structure shown in the
following example:

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	beans {
		dataSource(BasicDataSource) {
			driverClassName = "org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver"
			url = "jdbc:hsqldb:mem:grailsDB"
			username = "sa"
			password = ""
			settings = [mynew:"setting"]
		}
		sessionFactory(SessionFactory) {
			dataSource = dataSource
		}
		myService(MyService) {
			nestedBean = { AnotherBean bean ->
				dataSource = dataSource
			}
		}
	}
----

This configuration style is largely equivalent to XML bean definitions and even
supports Spring's XML configuration namespaces. It also allows for importing XML
bean definition files through an `importBeans` directive.



[[beans-factory-client]]
== Using the Container

The `ApplicationContext` is the interface for an advanced factory capable of maintaining
a registry of different beans and their dependencies. By using the method
`T getBean(String name, Class<T> requiredType)`, you can retrieve instances of your beans.

The `ApplicationContext` lets you read bean definitions and access them, as the following
example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	// create and configure beans
	ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("services.xml", "daos.xml");

	// retrieve configured instance
	PetStoreService service = context.getBean("petStore", PetStoreService.class);

	// use configured instance
	List<String> userList = service.getUsernameList();
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	import org.springframework.beans.factory.getBean

	// create and configure beans
	val context = ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("services.xml", "daos.xml")

	// retrieve configured instance
	val service = context.getBean<PetStoreService>("petStore")

	// use configured instance
	var userList = service.getUsernameList()
----
======

With Groovy configuration, bootstrapping looks very similar. It has a different context
implementation class which is Groovy-aware (but also understands XML bean definitions).
The following example shows Groovy configuration:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	ApplicationContext context = new GenericGroovyApplicationContext("services.groovy", "daos.groovy");
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
val context = GenericGroovyApplicationContext("services.groovy", "daos.groovy")
----
======

The most flexible variant is `GenericApplicationContext` in combination with reader
delegates -- for example, with `XmlBeanDefinitionReader` for XML files, as the following
example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	GenericApplicationContext context = new GenericApplicationContext();
	new XmlBeanDefinitionReader(context).loadBeanDefinitions("services.xml", "daos.xml");
	context.refresh();
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	val context = GenericApplicationContext()
	XmlBeanDefinitionReader(context).loadBeanDefinitions("services.xml", "daos.xml")
	context.refresh()
----
======

You can also use the `GroovyBeanDefinitionReader` for Groovy files, as the following
example shows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	GenericApplicationContext context = new GenericApplicationContext();
	new GroovyBeanDefinitionReader(context).loadBeanDefinitions("services.groovy", "daos.groovy");
	context.refresh();
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	val context = GenericApplicationContext()
	GroovyBeanDefinitionReader(context).loadBeanDefinitions("services.groovy", "daos.groovy")
	context.refresh()
----
======

You can mix and match such reader delegates on the same `ApplicationContext`,
reading bean definitions from diverse configuration sources.

You can then use `getBean` to retrieve instances of your beans. The `ApplicationContext`
interface has a few other methods for retrieving beans, but, ideally, your application
code should never use them. Indeed, your application code should have no calls to the
`getBean()` method at all and thus have no dependency on Spring APIs at all. For example,
Spring's integration with web frameworks provides dependency injection for various web
framework components such as controllers and JSF-managed beans, letting you declare
a dependency on a specific bean through metadata (such as an autowiring annotation).
