:page-section-summary-toc: 1

Testing is an integral part of enterprise software development. This chapter focuses on
the value added by the IoC principle to xref:testing/unit.adoc[unit testing] and on the benefits
of the Spring Framework's support for xref:testing/integration.adoc[integration testing]. (A
thorough treatment of testing in the enterprise is beyond the scope of this reference
manual.)
