:page-section-summary-toc: 1

The Spring MVC Test framework, also known as MockMvc, provides support for testing Spring
MVC applications. It performs full Spring MVC request handling but via mock request and
response objects instead of a running server.

MockMvc can be used on its own to perform requests and verify responses. It can also be
used through the xref:testing/webtestclient.adoc[WebTestClient] where MockMvc is plugged in as the server to handle
requests with. The advantage of `WebTestClient` is the option to work with higher level
objects instead of raw data as well as the ability to switch to full, end-to-end HTTP
tests against a live server and use the same test API.
