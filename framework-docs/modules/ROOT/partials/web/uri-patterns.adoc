|Pattern |Description |Example

| `spring`
| Literal pattern
| `+"/spring"+` matches `+"/spring"+`

| `+?+`
| Matches one character
| `+"/pages/t?st.html"+` matches `+"/pages/test.html"+` and `+"/pages/t3st.html"+`

| `+*+`
| Matches zero or more characters within a path segment
| `+"/resources/*.png"+` matches `+"/resources/file.png"+`

`+"/projects/*/versions"+` matches `+"/projects/spring/versions"+` but does not match `+"/projects/spring/boot/versions"+`.

`+"/projects/*"+` matches `+"/projects/spring"+` but does not match `+"/projects"+` as the path segment is not present.

| `+**+`
| Matches zero or more path segments
| `+"/resources/**"+` matches `+"/resources"+`, `+"/resources/file.png"+` and `+"/resources/images/file.png"+`

`+"/**/info"+` matches `+"/info"+`, `+"/spring/info"+` and `+"/spring/framework/info"+`

`+"/resources/**/file.png"+` is invalid as `+**+` is not allowed in the middle of the path.

`+"/**/spring/**"+` is not allowed, as only a single `+**+`/`+{*path}+` instance is allowed per pattern.

| `+{name}+`
| Similar to `+*+`, but also captures the path segment as a variable named "name"
| `+"/projects/{project}/versions"+` matches `+"/projects/spring/versions"+` and captures `+project=spring+`

`+"/projects/{project}/versions"+` does not match `+"/projects/spring/framework/versions"+` as it captures a single path segment.

| `{name:[a-z]+}`
| Matches the regexp `"[a-z]+"` as a path variable named "name"
| `"/projects/{project:[a-z]+}/versions"` matches `"/projects/spring/versions"` but not `"/projects/spring1/versions"`

| `+{*path}+`
| Similar to `+**+`, but also captures the path segments as a variable named "path"
| `+"/resources/{*file}"+` matches `+"/resources/images/file.png"+` and captures `+file=/images/file.png+`

`+"{*path}/resources"+` matches `+"/spring/framework/resources"+` and captures `+path=/spring/framework+`

`+"/resources/{*path}/file.png"+` is invalid as `{*path}` is not allowed in the middle of the path.

`+"/{*path}/spring/**"+` is not allowed, as only a single `+**+`/`+{*path}+` instance is allowed per pattern.
