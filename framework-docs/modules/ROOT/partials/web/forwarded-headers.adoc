As a request goes through proxies such as load balancers the host, port, and
scheme may change, and that makes it a challenge to create links that point to the correct
host, port, and scheme from a client perspective.

{rfc-site}/rfc7239[RFC 7239] defines the `Forwarded` HTTP header
that proxies can use to provide information about the original request.



[[forwarded-headers-non-standard]]
=== Non-standard Headers

There are other non-standard headers, too, including `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Port`,
`X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Ssl`, and `X-Forwarded-Prefix`.


[[x-forwarded-host]]
==== X-Forwarded-Host

While not standard, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Host[`X-Forwarded-Host: <host>`]
is a de-facto standard header that is used to communicate the original host to a
downstream server. For example, if a request of `https://example.com/resource` is sent to
a proxy which forwards the request to `http://localhost:8080/resource`, then a header of
`X-Forwarded-Host: example.com` can be sent to inform the server that the original host was `example.com`.


[[x-forwarded-port]]
==== X-Forwarded-Port

While not standard, `X-Forwarded-Port: <port>` is a de-facto standard header that is used to
communicate the original port to a downstream server. For example, if a request of
`https://example.com/resource` is sent to a proxy which forwards the request to
`http://localhost:8080/resource`, then a header of `X-Forwarded-Port: 443` can be sent
to inform the server that the original port was `443`.


[[x-forwarded-proto]]
==== X-Forwarded-Proto

While not standard, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Proto[`X-Forwarded-Proto: (https|http)`]
is a de-facto standard header that is used to communicate the original protocol (for example, https / http)
to a downstream server. For example, if a request of `https://example.com/resource` is sent to
a proxy which forwards the request to `http://localhost:8080/resource`, then a header of
`X-Forwarded-Proto: https` can be sent to inform the server that the original protocol was `https`.


[[x-forwarded-ssl]]
==== X-Forwarded-Ssl

While not standard, `X-Forwarded-Ssl: (on|off)` is a de-facto standard header that is used to communicate the
original protocol (for example, https / https) to a downstream server. For example, if a request of
`https://example.com/resource` is sent to a proxy which forwards the request to
`http://localhost:8080/resource`, then a header of `X-Forwarded-Ssl: on` to inform the server that the
original protocol was `https`.


[[x-forwarded-prefix]]
==== X-Forwarded-Prefix

While not standard, https://microsoft.github.io/reverse-proxy/articles/transforms.html#defaults[`X-Forwarded-Prefix: <prefix>`]
is a de-facto standard header that is used to communicate the original URL path prefix to a
downstream server.

Use of `X-Forwarded-Prefix` can vary by deployment scenario, and needs to be flexible to
allow replacing, removing, or prepending the path prefix of the target server.

_Scenario 1: Override path prefix_

[subs="-attributes"]
----
https://example.com/api/{path} -> http://localhost:8080/app1/{path}
----

The prefix is the start of the path before the capture group `+{path}+`. For the proxy,
the prefix is `/api` while for the server the prefix is `/app1`. In this case, the proxy
can send `X-Forwarded-Prefix: /api` to have the original prefix `/api` override the
server prefix `/app1`.

_Scenario 2: Remove path prefix_

At times, an application may want to have the prefix removed. For example, consider the
following proxy to server mapping:

[subs="-attributes"]
----
https://app1.example.com/{path} -> http://localhost:8080/app1/{path}
https://app2.example.com/{path} -> http://localhost:8080/app2/{path}
----

The proxy has no prefix, while applications `app1` and `app2` have path prefixes
`/app1` and `/app2` respectively. The proxy can send ``X-Forwarded-Prefix: `` to
have the empty prefix override server prefixes `/app1` and `/app2`.

[NOTE]
====
A common case for this deployment scenario is where licenses are paid per
production application server, and it is preferable to deploy multiple applications per
server to reduce fees. Another reason is to run more applications on the same server in
order to share the resources required by the server to run.

In these scenarios, applications need a non-empty context root because there are multiple
applications on the same server. However, this should not be visible in URL paths of
the public API where applications may use different subdomains that provides benefits
such as:

* Added security, for example, same origin policy
* Independent scaling of applications (different domain points to different IP address)
====

_Scenario 3: Insert path prefix_

In other cases, it may be necessary to prepend a prefix. For example, consider the
following proxy to server mapping:

[subs="-attributes"]
----
https://example.com/api/app1/{path} -> http://localhost:8080/app1/{path}
----

In this case, the proxy has a prefix of `/api/app1` and the server has a prefix of
`/app1`. The proxy can send `X-Forwarded-Prefix: /api/app1` to have the original prefix
`/api/app1` override the server prefix `/app1`.
