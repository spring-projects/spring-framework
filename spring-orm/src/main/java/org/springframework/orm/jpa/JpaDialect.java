/**
 * SPI strategy that encapsulates certain functionality that standard JPA 3.0 does

 * mainly intended for standalone usage of a JPA provider; most of its functionality
 * is not relevant when running with JTA transactions.
 *
 * <p>In general, it is recommended to derive from {@link DefaultJpaDialect} instead
 * of implementing this interface directly. This allows for inheriting common behavior
 * (present and future) from DefaultJpaDialect, only overriding specific hooks to
 * plug in concrete vendor-specific behavior.
