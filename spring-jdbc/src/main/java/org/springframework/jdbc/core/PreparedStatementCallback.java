/**
 * Generic callback interface for code that operates on a PreparedStatement.
 * Allows to execute any number of operations on a single PreparedStatement,
 * for example a single {@code executeUpdate} call or repeated
 * {@code executeUpdate} calls with varying parameters.
 *
 * <p>Used internally by JdbcTemplate, but also useful for application code.
 * Note that the passed-in PreparedStatement can have been created by the
 * framework or by a custom PreparedStatementCreator. However, the latter is
 * hardly ever necessary, as most custom callback actions will perform updates
 * in which case a standard PreparedStatement is fine. Custom actions will
 * always set parameter values themselves, so that PreparedStatementCreator
 * capability is not needed either.

	/**
	 * Gets called by {@code JdbcTemplate.execute} with an active JDBC
	 * PreparedStatement. Does not need to care about closing the Statement
	 * or the Connection, or about handling transactions: this will all be
	 * handled by Spring's JdbcTemplate.
	 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> Any ResultSets opened should be closed in finally blocks
	 * within the callback implementation. Spring will close the Statement
	 * object after the callback returned, but this does not necessarily imply
	 * that the ResultSet resources will be closed: the Statement objects might
	 * get pooled by the connection pool, with {@code close} calls only
	 * returning the object to the pool but not physically closing the resources.
	 * <p>If called without a thread-bound JDBC transaction (initiated by
	 * DataSourceTransactionManager), the code will simply get executed on the
	 * JDBC connection with its transactional semantics. If JdbcTemplate is
	 * configured to use a JTA-aware DataSource, the JDBC connection and thus
	 * the callback code will be transactional if a JTA transaction is active.
	 * <p>Allows for returning a result object created within the callback, i.e.
	 * a domain object or a collection of domain objects. Note that there's
	 * special support for single step actions: see JdbcTemplate.queryForObject etc.
	 * A thrown RuntimeException is treated as application exception, it gets
	 * propagated to the caller of the template.
	 * @param ps active JDBC PreparedStatement
	 * @return a result object, or {@code null} if none
	 * @throws SQLException if thrown by a JDBC method, to be auto-converted
	 * to a DataAccessException by an SQLExceptionTranslator
	 * @throws DataAccessException in case of custom exceptions
