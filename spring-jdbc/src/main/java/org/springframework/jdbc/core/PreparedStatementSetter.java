/**
 * General callback interface used by the {@link JdbcTemplate} class.
 *
 * <p>This interface sets values on a {@link java.sql.PreparedStatement} provided
 * by the JdbcTemplate class, for each of a number of updates in a batch using the
 * same SQL. Implementations are responsible for setting any necessary parameters.
 * SQL with placeholders will already have been supplied.
 *
 * <p>It's easier to use this interface than {@link PreparedStatementCreator}:
 * The JdbcTemplate will create the PreparedStatement, with the callback
 * only being responsible for setting parameter values.
 *
 * <p>Implementations <i>do not</i> need to concern themselves with
 * SQLExceptions that may be thrown from operations they attempt.
 * The JdbcTemplate class will catch and handle SQLExceptions appropriately.
