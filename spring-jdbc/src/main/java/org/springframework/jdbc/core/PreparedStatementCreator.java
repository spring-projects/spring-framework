/**
 * One of the two central callback interfaces used by the JdbcTemplate class.
 * This interface creates a PreparedStatement given a connection, provided
 * by the JdbcTemplate class. Implementations are responsible for providing
 * SQL and any necessary parameters.
 *
 * <p>Implementations <i>do not</i> need to concern themselves with
 * SQLExceptions that may be thrown from operations they attempt.
 * The JdbcTemplate class will catch and handle SQLExceptions appropriately.
 *
 * <p>A PreparedStatementCreator should also implement the SqlProvider interface
 * if it is able to provide the SQL it uses for PreparedStatement creation.
 * This allows for better contextual information in case of exceptions.
