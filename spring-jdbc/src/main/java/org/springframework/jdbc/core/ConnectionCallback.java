/**
 * Generic callback interface for code that operates on a JDBC Connection.
 * Allows to execute any number of operations on a single Connection,
 * using any type and number of Statements.
 *
 * <p>This is particularly useful for delegating to existing data access code
 * that expects a Connection to work on and throws SQLException. For newly
 * written code, it is strongly recommended to use JdbcTemplate's more specific
 * operations, for example a {@code query} or {@code update} variant.

	 * Gets called by {@code JdbcTemplate.execute} with an active JDBC
	 * Connection. Does not need to care about activating or closing the
	 * Connection, or handling transactions.
	 * <p>If called without a thread-bound JDBC transaction (initiated by
	 * DataSourceTransactionManager), the code will simply get executed on the
	 * JDBC connection with its transactional semantics. If JdbcTemplate is
	 * configured to use a JTA-aware DataSource, the JDBC Connection and thus
	 * the callback code will be transactional if a JTA transaction is active.
	 * <p>Allows for returning a result object created within the callback, i.e.
	 * a domain object or a collection of domain objects. Note that there's special
	 * support for single step actions: see {@code JdbcTemplate.queryForObject}
	 * etc. A thrown RuntimeException is treated as application exception:
	 * it gets propagated to the caller of the template.
