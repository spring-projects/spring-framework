/**

	/**
	 * Gets called by {@code JdbcTemplate.execute} with an active JDBC
	 * Statement. Does not need to care about closing the Statement or the
	 * Connection, or about handling transactions: this will all be handled
	 * by Spring's JdbcTemplate.
	 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> Any ResultSets opened should be closed in finally blocks
	 * within the callback implementation. Spring will close the Statement
	 * object after the callback returned, but this does not necessarily imply
	 * that the ResultSet resources will be closed: the Statement objects might
	 * get pooled by the connection pool, with {@code close} calls only
	 * returning the object to the pool but not physically closing the resources.
	 * <p>If called without a thread-bound JDBC transaction (initiated by
	 * DataSourceTransactionManager), the code will simply get executed on the
	 * JDBC connection with its transactional semantics. If JdbcTemplate is
	 * configured to use a JTA-aware DataSource, the JDBC connection and thus
	 * the callback code will be transactional if a JTA transaction is active.
	 * <p>Allows for returning a result object created within the callback, i.e.
	 * a domain object or a collection of domain objects. Note that there's
	 * special support for single step actions: see JdbcTemplate.queryForObject etc.
	 * A thrown RuntimeException is treated as application exception, it gets
	 * propagated to the caller of the template.
	 * @param stmt active JDBC Statement
	 * @return a result object, or {@code null} if none
	 * @throws SQLException if thrown by a JDBC method, to be auto-converted
	 * to a DataAccessException by an SQLExceptionTranslator
	 * @throws DataAccessException in case of custom exceptions
	 * @see JdbcTemplate#queryForObject(String, Class)
	 * @see JdbcTemplate#queryForRowSet(String)
