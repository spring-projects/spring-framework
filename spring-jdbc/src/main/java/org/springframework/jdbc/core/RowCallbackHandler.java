/**
 * An interface used by {@link JdbcTemplate} and

 * NamedParameterJdbcTemplate} for processing rows of a
 * {@link java.sql.ResultSet} on a per-row basis. Implementations of
 * this interface perform the actual work of processing each row
 * but don't need to worry about exception handling.
 * {@link java.sql.SQLException SQLExceptions} will be caught and handled
 * by the calling {@code JdbcTemplate} or {@code NamedParameterJdbcTemplate}.
 *
 * <p>In contrast to a {@link ResultSetExtractor}, a {@code RowCallbackHandler}
 * object is typically stateful: it keeps the result state within the
 * object, to be available for later inspection. See
 * {@link RowCountCallbackHandler} for a usage example.
 *
 * <p>Consider using a {@link RowMapper} instead if you need to map
 * exactly one result object per row, assembling them into a List.
