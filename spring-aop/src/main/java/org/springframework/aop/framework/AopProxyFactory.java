 * Interface to be implemented by factories that are able to create

 * <p>Proxies should observe the following contract:
 * <ul>
 * <li>They should implement all interfaces that the configuration
 * indicates should be proxied.
 * <li>They should implement the {@link Advised} interface.
 * <li>They should implement the equals method to compare proxied
 * interfaces, advice, and target.
 * <li>They should be serializable if all advisors and target
 * are serializable.
 * <li>They should be thread-safe if advisors and target
 * are thread-safe.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Proxies may or may not allow advice changes to be made.
 * If they do not permit advice changes (for example, because
 * the configuration was frozen) a proxy should throw an 
 * {@link AopConfigException} on an attempted advice change.
