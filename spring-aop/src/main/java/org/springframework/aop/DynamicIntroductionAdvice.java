/**
 * Subinterface of AOP Alliance Advice that allows additional interfaces
 * to be implemented by an Advice, and available via a proxy using that
 * interceptor. This is a fundamental AOP concept called <b>introduction</b>.
 *
 * <p>Introductions are often <b>mixins</b>, enabling the building of composite
 * objects that can achieve many of the goals of multiple inheritance in Java.
 *
 * <p>Compared to {@link IntroductionInfo}, this interface allows an advice to
 * implement a range of interfaces that is not necessarily known in advance.
 * Thus an {@link IntroductionAdvisor} can be used to specify which interfaces
 * will be exposed in an advised object.
