/**
 * Part of a {@link Pointcut}: Checks whether the target method is eligible for advice.
 *
 * <p>A {@code MethodMatcher} may be evaluated <b>statically</b> or at <b>runtime</b>
 * (dynamically). Static matching involves a method and (possibly) method attributes.
 * Dynamic matching also makes arguments for a particular call available, and any
 * effects of running previous advice applying to the joinpoint.
 *
 * <p>If an implementation returns {@code false} from its {@link #isRuntime()}
 * method, evaluation can be performed statically, and the result will be the same
 * for all invocations of this method, whatever their arguments. This means that
 * if the {@link #isRuntime()} method returns {@code false}, the 3-arg
 * {@link #matches(Method, Class, Object[])} method will never be invoked.
 *
 * <p>If an implementation returns {@code true} from its 2-arg
 * {@link #matches(Method, Class)} method and its {@link #isRuntime()} method
 * returns {@code true}, the 3-arg {@link #matches(Method, Class, Object[])}
 * method will be invoked <i>immediately before each potential execution of the
 * related advice</i> to decide whether the advice should run. All previous advice,
 * such as earlier interceptors in an interceptor chain, will have run, so any
 * state changes they have produced in parameters or {@code ThreadLocal} state will
 * be available at the time of evaluation.
 *
 * <p><strong>WARNING</strong>: Concrete implementations of this interface must
 * provide proper implementations of {@link Object#equals(Object)},
 * {@link Object#hashCode()}, and {@link Object#toString()} in order to allow the
 * matcher to be used in caching scenarios &mdash; for example, in proxies generated
 * by CGLIB. As of Spring Framework 6.0.13, the {@code toString()} implementation
 * must generate a unique string representation that aligns with the logic used
 * to implement {@code equals()}. See concrete implementations of this interface
 * within the framework for examples.
