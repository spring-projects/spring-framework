/**
 * Part of a {@link Pointcut}: Checks whether the target method is eligible for advice.
 *
 * <p>A MethodMatcher may be evaluated <b>statically</b> or at <b>runtime</b> (dynamically).
 * Static matching involves method and (possibly) method attributes. Dynamic matching
 * also makes arguments for a particular call available, and any effects of running
 * previous advice applying to the joinpoint.
 *
 * <p>If an implementation returns {@code false} from its {@link #isRuntime()}
 * method, evaluation can be performed statically, and the result will be the same
 * for all invocations of this method, whatever their arguments. This means that
 * if the {@link #isRuntime()} method returns {@code false}, the 3-arg
 * {@link #matches(java.lang.reflect.Method, Class, Object[])} method will never be invoked.
 *
 * <p>If an implementation returns {@code true} from its 2-arg
 * {@link #matches(java.lang.reflect.Method, Class)} method and its {@link #isRuntime()} method
 * returns {@code true}, the 3-arg {@link #matches(java.lang.reflect.Method, Class, Object[])}
 * method will be invoked <i>immediately before each potential execution of the related advice</i>,
 * to decide whether the advice should run. All previous advice, such as earlier interceptors
 * in an interceptor chain, will have run, so any state changes they have produced in
 * parameters or ThreadLocal state will be available at the time of evaluation.
