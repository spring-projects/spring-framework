/**
 * This interface represents a generic runtime joinpoint (in the AOP

 * <p>A runtime joinpoint is an <i>event</i> that occurs on a static
 * joinpoint (i.e. a location in a program). For instance, an
 * invocation is the runtime joinpoint on a method (static joinpoint).
 * The static part of a given joinpoint can be generically retrieved
 * using the {@link #getStaticPart()} method.
 *
 * <p>In the context of an interception framework, a runtime joinpoint
 * is then the reification of an access to an accessible object (a
 * method, a constructor, a field), i.e. the static part of the
 * joinpoint. It is passed to the interceptors that are installed on
 * the static joinpoint.
