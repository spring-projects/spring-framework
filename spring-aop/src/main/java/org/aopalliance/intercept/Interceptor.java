/**
 * This interface represents a generic interceptor.
 *
 * <p>A generic interceptor can intercept runtime events that occur
 * within a base program. Those events are materialized by (reified
 * in) joinpoints. Runtime joinpoints can be invocations, field
 * access, exceptions...
 *
 * <p>This interface is not used directly. Use the sub-interfaces
 * to intercept specific events. For instance, the following class
 * implements some specific interceptors in order to implement a
 * debugger:
 *
 * <pre class=code>
 * class DebuggingInterceptor implements MethodInterceptor,
 *     ConstructorInterceptor {
 *
 *   Object invoke(MethodInvocation i) throws Throwable {
 *     debug(i.getMethod(), i.getThis(), i.getArgs());
 *     return i.proceed();
 *   }
 *
 *   Object construct(ConstructorInvocation i) throws Throwable {
 *     debug(i.getConstructor(), i.getThis(), i.getArgs());
 *     return i.proceed();
 *   }
 *
 *   void debug(AccessibleObject ao, Object this, Object value) {
 *     ...
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
