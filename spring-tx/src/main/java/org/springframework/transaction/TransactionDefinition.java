 * {@link #PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW} and {@link #PROPAGATION_NESTED} can cause
 * that, it usually doesn't make sense to specify those settings in other cases.
 * Furthermore, be aware that not all transaction managers will support those

 * non-default values.

 * <p>The {@link #isReadOnly() read-only flag} applies to any transaction context,
 * whether backed by an actual resource transaction or operating non-transactionally
 * at the resource level. In the latter case, the flag will only apply to managed
 * resources within the application, such as a Hibernate <code>Session</code>.
