/**
 * Interface for transaction synchronization callbacks.
 * Supported by AbstractPlatformTransactionManager.
 *
 * <p>TransactionSynchronization implementations can implement the Ordered interface
 * to influence their execution order. A synchronization that does not implement the
 * Ordered interface is appended to the end of the synchronization chain.
 *
 * <p>System synchronizations performed by Spring itself use specific order values,
 * allowing for fine-grained interaction with their execution order (if necessary).
 *
 * <p>Implements the {@link Ordered} interface to enable the execution order of
 * synchronizations to be controlled declaratively. The default {@link #getOrder()
 * order} is {@link Ordered#LOWEST_PRECEDENCE}, indicating late execution; return
 * a lower value for earlier execution.
