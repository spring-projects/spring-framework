/**
 * Abstract superclass for PDF views that operate on an existing

 * <p>This view implementation uses Bruno Lowagie's
 * <a href="https://www.lowagie.com/iText">iText</a> API.
 * Known to work with the original iText 2.1.7 as well as its fork
 * <a href="https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF">OpenPDF</a>.
 * <b>We strongly recommend OpenPDF since it is actively maintained
 * and fixes an important vulnerability for untrusted PDF content.</b>
 *
 * <p>Thanks to Bryant Larsen for the suggestion and the original prototype!

	 * // set some values on the form

	 * for setting cookies or other HTTP headers. The built PDF document itself
	 * will automatically get written to the response after this method returns.
	 * @param model the model Map
	 * @param stamper the PdfStamper instance that will contain the AcroFields.
	 * You may also customize this PdfStamper instance according to your needs,
	 * for example, setting the "formFlattening" property.
	 * @param request in case we need locale etc. Shouldn't look at attributes.
	 * @param response in case we need to set cookies. Shouldn't write to it.
	 * @throws Exception any exception that occurred during document building
