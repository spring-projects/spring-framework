/**
 * Extends {@code HandlerInterceptor} with a callback method invoked after the
 * start of asynchronous request handling.
 *
 * <p>When a handler starts an asynchronous request, the {@link DispatcherServlet}
 * exits without invoking {@code postHandle} and {@code afterCompletion} as it
 * normally does for a synchronous request, since the result of request handling
 * (for example, ModelAndView) is likely not yet ready and will be produced concurrently
 * from another thread. In such scenarios, {@link #afterConcurrentHandlingStarted}
 * is invoked instead, allowing implementations to perform tasks such as cleaning
 * up thread-bound attributes before releasing the thread to the Servlet container.
 *
 * <p>When asynchronous handling completes, the request is dispatched to the
 * container for further processing. At this stage the {@code DispatcherServlet}
 * invokes {@code preHandle}, {@code postHandle}, and {@code afterCompletion}.
 * To distinguish between the initial request and the subsequent dispatch
 * after asynchronous handling completes, interceptors can check whether the
 * {@code jakarta.servlet.DispatcherType} of {@link jakarta.servlet.ServletRequest}
 * is {@code "REQUEST"} or {@code "ASYNC"}.
 *
 * <p>Note that {@code HandlerInterceptor} implementations may need to do work
 * when an async request times out or completes with a network error. For such
 * cases the Servlet container does not dispatch and therefore the
 * {@code postHandle} and {@code afterCompletion} methods will not be invoked.
 * Instead, interceptors can register to track an asynchronous request through
 * the {@code registerCallbackInterceptor} and {@code registerDeferredResultInterceptor}
 * methods on {@link org.springframework.web.context.request.async.WebAsyncManager
 * WebAsyncManager}. This can be done proactively on every request from
 * {@code preHandle} regardless of whether async request processing will start.
