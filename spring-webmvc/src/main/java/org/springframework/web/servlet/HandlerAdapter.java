/**
 * MVC framework SPI, allowing parameterization of the core MVC workflow.
 *
 * <p>Interface that must be implemented for each handler type to handle a request.
 * This interface is used to allow the {@link DispatcherServlet} to be indefinitely
 * extensible. The {@code DispatcherServlet} accesses all installed handlers through
 * this interface, meaning that it does not contain code specific to any handler type.
 *
 * <p>Note that a handler can be of type {@code Object}. This is to enable
 * handlers from other frameworks to be integrated with this framework without
 * custom coding, as well as to allow for annotation-driven handler objects that
 * do not obey any specific Java interface.
 *
 * <p>This interface is not intended for application developers. It is available
 * to handlers who want to develop their own web workflow.
 *
 * <p>Note: {@code HandlerAdapter} implementors may implement the {@link
 * org.springframework.core.Ordered} interface to be able to specify a sorting
 * order (and thus a priority) for getting applied by the {@code DispatcherServlet}.
 * Non-Ordered instances get treated as the lowest priority.
