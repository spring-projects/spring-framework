/**
 * Annotation to map the initial {@link ConnectionSetupPayload} and subsequent
 * metadata pushes onto a handler method.
 *
 * <p>This is a method-level annotation that can be combined with a type-level
 * {@link org.springframework.messaging.handler.annotation.MessageMapping @MessageMapping}
 * for a combined route pattern. It supports the same arguments as
 * {@code @MessageMapping} but the return value must be {@code void}. On a
 * server, handling can be asynchronous (for example, {@code Mono<Void>}), in which
 * case the connection is accepted if and when the {@code Mono<Void>} completes.
 * On the client side this method is only a callback and does not affect the
 * establishment of the connection.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> an {@code @ConnectMapping} method may start
 * requests to the remote through an
 * {@link org.springframework.messaging.rsocket.RSocketRequester RSocketRequester}
 * method argument, but it must do so independent of the handling thread (for example,
 * via subscribing on a different thread).
