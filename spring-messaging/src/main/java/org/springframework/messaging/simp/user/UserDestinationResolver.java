/**
 * A strategy for resolving a "user" destination by translating it to one or more

 * user destination, the destination must contain the user name so it may be
 * extracted and used to look up the user sessions. When subscribing to a user
 * destination, the destination does not have to contain the user's own name.
 * We simply use the current session.
 *
 * <p>See implementation classes and the documentation for example destinations.
