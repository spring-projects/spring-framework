 * algorithm (including delegation to {@link java.beans.PropertyEditor} and
 * {@link org.springframework.core.convert.ConversionService}) underneath.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> Due to its reliance on {@link java.beans.PropertyEditor PropertyEditors},
 * SimpleTypeConverter is <em>not</em> thread-safe. Use a separate instance for each thread.
