/**
 * An annotation that indicates 'lookup' methods, to be overridden by the container
 * to redirect them back to the {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory}
 * for a {@code getBean} call. This is essentially an annotation-based version of the
 * XML {@code lookup-method} attribute, resulting in the same runtime arrangement.
 *
 * <p>The resolution of the target bean can either be based on the return type
 * ({@code getBean(Class)}) or on a suggested bean name ({@code getBean(String)}),
 * in both cases passing the method's arguments to the {@code getBean} call
 * for applying them as target factory method arguments or constructor arguments.
 *
 * <p>Such lookup methods can have default (stub) implementations that will simply
 * get replaced by the container, or they can be declared as abstract - for the
 * container to fill them in at runtime. In both cases, the container will generate
 * runtime subclasses of the method's containing class via CGLIB, which is why such
 * lookup methods can only work on beans that the container instantiates through
 * regular constructors: i.e. lookup methods cannot get replaced on beans returned
 * from factory methods where we cannot dynamically provide a subclass for them.
 *
 * <p><b>Recommendations for typical Spring configuration scenarios:</b>
 * When a concrete class may be needed in certain scenarios, consider providing stub
 * implementations of your lookup methods. And please remember that lookup methods
 * won't work on beans returned from {@code @Bean} methods in configuration classes;
 * you'll have to resort to {@code @Inject Provider<TargetBean>} or the like instead.
