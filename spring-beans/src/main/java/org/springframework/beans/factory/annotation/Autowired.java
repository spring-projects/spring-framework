/**
 * Marks a constructor, field, setter method, or config method as to be autowired by
 * Spring's dependency injection facilities. This is an alternative to the JSR-330
 * {@link javax.inject.Inject} annotation, adding required-vs-optional semantics.
 *
 * <p>Only one constructor of any given bean class may declare this annotation with
 * the 'required' attribute set to {@code true}, indicating <i>the</i> constructor
 * to autowire when used as a Spring bean. Furthermore, if the 'required' attribute
 * is set to {@code true}, only a single constructor may be annotated with
 * {@code @Autowired}. If multiple <i>non-required</i> constructors declare the
 * annotation, they will be considered as candidates for autowiring. The constructor
 * with the greatest number of dependencies that can be satisfied by matching beans
 * in the Spring container will be chosen. If none of the candidates can be satisfied,
 * then a primary/default constructor (if present) will be used. If a class only
 * declares a single constructor to begin with, it will always be used, even if not
 * annotated. An annotated constructor does not have to be public.
 *
 * <p>Fields are injected right after construction of a bean, before any config methods
 * are invoked. Such a config field does not have to be public.
 *
 * <p>Config methods may have an arbitrary name and any number of arguments; each of
 * those arguments will be autowired with a matching bean in the Spring container.
 * Bean property setter methods are effectively just a special case of such a general
 * config method. Such config methods do not have to be public.
 *
 * <p>In the case of a multi-arg constructor or method, the 'required' attribute is
 * applicable to all arguments. Individual parameters may be declared as Java-8-style
 * {@link java.util.Optional}, overriding the base required semantics.
 *
 * <p>In case of a {@link java.util.Collection} or {@link java.util.Map} dependency type,
 * the container autowires all beans matching the declared value type. For such purposes,
 * the map keys must be declared as type String which will be resolved to the corresponding
 * bean names. Such a container-provided collection will be ordered, taking into account
 * {@link org.springframework.core.Ordered}/{@link org.springframework.core.annotation.Order}
 * values of the target components, otherwise following their registration order in the
 * container. Alternatively, a single matching target bean may also be a generally typed
 * {@code Collection} or {@code Map} itself, getting injected as such.
 *
 * <p>Note that actual injection is performed through a
 * {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanPostProcessor
 * BeanPostProcessor} which in turn means that you <em>cannot</em>
 * use {@code @Autowired} to inject references into
 * {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanPostProcessor
 * BeanPostProcessor} or
 * {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanFactoryPostProcessor BeanFactoryPostProcessor}
 * types. Please consult the javadoc for the {@link AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor}
 * class (which, by default, checks for the presence of this annotation).
