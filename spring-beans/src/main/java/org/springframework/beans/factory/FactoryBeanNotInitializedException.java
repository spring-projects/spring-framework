/**
 * Exception to be thrown from a FactoryBean's {@code getObject()} method
 * if the bean is not fully initialized yet, for example because it is involved
 * in a circular reference.
 *
 * <p>Note: A circular reference with a FactoryBean cannot be solved by eagerly
 * caching singleton instances like with normal beans. The reason is that
 * <i>every</i> FactoryBean needs to be fully initialized before it can
 * return the created bean, while only <i>specific</i> normal beans need
 * to be initialized - that is, if a collaborating bean actually invokes
 * them on initialization instead of just storing the reference.
