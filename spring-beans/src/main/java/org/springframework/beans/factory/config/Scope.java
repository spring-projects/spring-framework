/**
 * Strategy interface used by a {@link ConfigurableBeanFactory},
 * representing a target scope to hold bean instances in.
 * This allows for extending the BeanFactory's standard scopes
 * {@link ConfigurableBeanFactory#SCOPE_SINGLETON "singleton"} and
 * {@link ConfigurableBeanFactory#SCOPE_PROTOTYPE "prototype"}
 * with custom further scopes, registered for a
 * {@link ConfigurableBeanFactory#registerScope(String, Scope) specific key}.
 *
 * <p>{@link org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext} implementations
 * such as a {@link org.springframework.web.context.WebApplicationContext}
 * may register additional standard scopes specific to their environment,
 * e.g. {@link org.springframework.web.context.WebApplicationContext#SCOPE_REQUEST "request"}
 * and {@link org.springframework.web.context.WebApplicationContext#SCOPE_SESSION "session"},
 * based on this Scope SPI.
 *
 * <p>Even if its primary use is for extended scopes in a web environment,
 * this SPI is completely generic: It provides the ability to get and put
 * objects from any underlying storage mechanism, such as an HTTP session
 * or a custom conversation mechanism. The name passed into this class's
 * {@code get} and {@code remove} methods will identify the
 * target object in the current scope.
 *
 * <p>{@code Scope} implementations are expected to be thread-safe.
 * One {@code Scope} instance can be used with multiple bean factories
 * at the same time, if desired (unless it explicitly wants to be aware of
 * the containing BeanFactory), with any number of threads accessing
 * the {@code Scope} concurrently from any number of factories.
