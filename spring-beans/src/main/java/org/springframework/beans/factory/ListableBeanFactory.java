/**
 * Extension of the {@link BeanFactory} interface to be implemented by bean factories
 * that can enumerate all their bean instances, rather than attempting bean lookup
 * by name one by one as requested by clients. BeanFactory implementations that
 * preload all their bean definitions (such as XML-based factories) may implement
 * this interface.
 *
 * <p>If this is a {@link HierarchicalBeanFactory}, the return values will <i>not</i>
 * take any BeanFactory hierarchy into account, but will relate only to the beans
 * defined in the current factory. Use the {@link BeanFactoryUtils} helper class
 * to consider beans in ancestor factories too.
 *
 * <p>The methods in this interface will just respect bean definitions of this factory.
 * They will ignore any singleton beans that have been registered by other means like
 * {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableBeanFactory}'s
 * {@code registerSingleton} method, with the exception of
 * {@code getBeanNamesForType} and {@code getBeansOfType} which will check
 * such manually registered singletons too. Of course, BeanFactory's {@code getBean}
 * does allow transparent access to such special beans as well. However, in typical
 * scenarios, all beans will be defined by external bean definitions anyway, so most
 * applications don't need to worry about this differentiation.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> With the exception of {@code getBeanDefinitionCount}
 * and {@code containsBeanDefinition}, the methods in this interface
 * are not designed for frequent invocation. Implementations may be slow.
 *
 * <p>能获取的BeanFactory(ListableBeanFactory)
 * <p>扩展{@link BeanFactory}接口，由可以枚举所有bean实例的bean工厂实现，而不是根据客户端的请求逐一尝试按名称查找bean。
 * 预加载所有bean定义的BeanFactory实现（如基于XML的工厂）可以实现此接口
 * <p> 如果这是一个{@link HierarchicalBeanFactory}，则返回值将<i>不考虑任何BeanFactory层次结构，而仅与当前工厂中定义的bean相关。
 * 使用{@link BeanFactory Utils}辅助类来考虑祖先工厂中的bean
 * <p> 此接口中的方法将只尊重此工厂的bean定义。它们将忽略通过其他方式注册的任何单例bean，
 * 如{@link org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableBeanFactory}的{@code registerSingleton}方法，
 * 但{@code getBeanNameForType}和{@code get BeansOfType}除外，它们也将检查此类手动注册的单例bean。
 * 当然，BeanFactory的{@code getBean}也允许透明访问这种特殊的bean。然而，在典型场景中，所有bean都将由外部bean定义定义，因此大多数应用程序不需要担心这种差异
 * <p><b>注意：<b>除了{@code getBeanDefinition Count}和{@code contains BeanDefinition}之外，此接口中的方法不是为频繁调用而设计的。实施可能很慢。
