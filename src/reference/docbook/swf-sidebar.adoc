****
Spring Web Flow (SWF) aims to be the best solution for the management of web application page flow.

SWF integrates with existing frameworks like Spring MVC, Struts, and JSF, in both servlet and portlet environments.
If you have a business process (or processes) that would benefit from a conversational model as opposed to a purely request model, then SWF may be the solution.

SWF allows you to capture logical page flows as self-contained modules that are reusable in different situations, and as such is ideal for building web application modules that guide the user through controlled navigations that drive business processes.

For more information about SWF, consult the <<,Spring Web Flow website>>.
