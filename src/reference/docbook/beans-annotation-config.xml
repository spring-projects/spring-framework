  <title>Annotation-based container configuration</title>

  <sidebar>
    <title>Are annotations better than XML for configuring Spring?</title>

    <para>The introduction of annotation-based configurations raised the
      question of whether this approach is 'better' than XML. The short answer
      is <emphasis>it depends</emphasis>. The long answer is that each approach
      has its pros and cons, and usually it is up to the developer to decide
      which strategy suits her better. Due to the way they are defined,
      annotations provide a lot of context in their declaration, leading to
      shorter and more concise configuration. However, XML excels at wiring up
      components without touching their source code or recompiling them. Some
      developers prefer having the wiring close to the source while others argue
      that annotated classes are no longer POJOs and, furthermore, that the
      configuration becomes decentralized and harder to control.</para>

    <para>No matter the choice, Spring can accommodate both styles and even mix
      them together. It's worth pointing out that through its <link
      linkend="beans-java">JavaConfig</link> option, Spring allows annotations
      to be used in a non-invasive way, without touching the target components
      source code and that in terms of tooling, all configuration styles are
      supported by the <link xl:href="http://www.springsource.com/products/sts"
      >SpringSource Tool Suite</link>.</para>
  </sidebar>

  <para>An alternative to XML setups is provided by annotation-based
    configuration which rely on the bytecode metadata for wiring up components
    instead of angle-bracket declarations. Instead of using XML to describe a
    bean wiring, the developer moves the configuration into the component class
    itself by using annotations on the relevant class, method, or field
    declaration. As mentioned in <xref
    linkend="beans-factory-extension-bpp-examples-rabpp"/>, using a
    <interfacename>BeanPostProcessor</interfacename> in conjunction with
    annotations is a common means of extending the Spring IoC container. For
    example, Spring 2.0 introduced the possibility of enforcing required
    properties with the <link linkend="beans-required-annotation"
    >@Required</link> annotation. Spring 2.5 made it possible to follow
    that same general approach to drive Spring's dependency injection.
    Essentially, the <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> annotation
    provides the same capabilities as described in <xref
    linkend="beans-factory-autowire"/> but with more fine-grained control and
    wider applicability. Spring 2.5 also added support for JSR-250 annotations
    such as <interfacename>@PostConstruct</interfacename>, and
    <interfacename>@PreDestroy</interfacename>. Spring 3.0 added support for
    JSR-330 (Dependency Injection for Java) annotations contained in the
    javax.inject package such as <classname>@Inject</classname> and
    <literal> @Named</literal>. Details about those annotations can be found in the <link linkend="beans-standard-annotations"
    >relevant section</link>. <note><para>Annotation injection is performed
    <emphasis>before</emphasis> XML injection, thus the latter configuration
    will override the former for properties wired through both approaches.
    </para></note> As always, you can register them as individual bean definitions, but
    they can also be implicitly registered by including the following tag in an
    XML-based Spring configuration (notice the inclusion of the
    <literal>context</literal> namespace):</para>

  <programlisting language="xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

    ><classname>RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor</classname></link>.)</para>

  <note>
    <para><literal>&lt;context:annotation-config/&gt;</literal> only looks for
      annotations on beans in the same application context in which it is
      defined. This means that, if you put
      <literal>&lt;context:annotation-config/&gt;</literal> in a
      <interfacename>WebApplicationContext</interfacename> for a
      <classname>DispatcherServlet</classname>, it only checks for
      <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> beans in your controllers, and
      not your services. See <xref linkend="mvc-servlet"/> for more
      information.</para>
  </note>

  <section xml:id="beans-required-annotation">
    <title><interfacename>@Required</interfacename></title>

    <para>The <interfacename>@Required</interfacename> annotation applies to
      bean property setter methods, as in the following example:</para>

    <programlisting language="java">public class SimpleMovieLister {

  private MovieFinder movieFinder;

  @Required
  public void setMovieFinder(MovieFinder movieFinder) {
      this.movieFinder = movieFinder;
  }

  <lineannotation>// ...</lineannotation>
}</programlisting>

    <para>This annotation simply indicates that the affected bean property must
      be populated at configuration time, through an explicit property value in
      a bean definition or through autowiring. The container throws an exception
      if the affected bean property has not been populated; this allows for
      eager and explicit failure, avoiding
      <classname>NullPointerException</classname>s or the like later on. It is
      still recommended that you put assertions into the bean class itself, for
      example, into an init method. Doing so enforces those required references
      and values even when you use the class outside of a container.</para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="beans-autowired-annotation">
    <title><interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename></title>

    <para>As expected, you can apply the
      <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> annotation to "traditional"
      setter methods:</para>



    <programlisting language="java">public class SimpleMovieLister {

  private MovieFinder movieFinder;

  @Autowired
  public void setMovieFinder(MovieFinder movieFinder) {
      this.movieFinder = movieFinder;
  }

  <lineannotation>// ...</lineannotation>
}</programlisting>

    <note>
      <para>JSR 330's @Inject annotation can be used in place of Spring's
        <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> annotation in the examples below. See <link linkend="beans-standard-annotations"
    >here</link> for more details</para>
    </note>


    <para>You can also apply the annotation to methods with arbitrary names
      and/or multiple arguments:</para>

    <programlisting language="java">public class MovieRecommender {

  private MovieCatalog movieCatalog;

  private CustomerPreferenceDao customerPreferenceDao;

  @Autowired
  public void prepare(MovieCatalog movieCatalog,
                      CustomerPreferenceDao customerPreferenceDao) {
      this.movieCatalog = movieCatalog;
      this.customerPreferenceDao = customerPreferenceDao;
  }

  <lineannotation>// ...</lineannotation>
}</programlisting>

    <para>You can apply <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> to
      constructors and fields:</para>

    <programlisting language="java">public class MovieRecommender {

  @Autowired
  private MovieCatalog movieCatalog;

  private CustomerPreferenceDao customerPreferenceDao;

  @Autowired
  public MovieRecommender(CustomerPreferenceDao customerPreferenceDao) {
      this.customerPreferenceDao = customerPreferenceDao;
  }

  <lineannotation>// ...</lineannotation>
}</programlisting>

    <para>It is also possible to provide <emphasis>all</emphasis> beans of a
      particular type from the <interfacename>ApplicationContext</interfacename>
      by adding the annotation to a field or method that expects an array of
      that type:</para>

    <programlisting language="java">public class MovieRecommender {

  @Autowired
  private MovieCatalog[] movieCatalogs;

  <lineannotation>// ...</lineannotation>
}</programlisting>

    <para>The same applies for typed collections:</para>

    <programlisting language="java">public class MovieRecommender {

  private Set&lt;MovieCatalog&gt; movieCatalogs;

  @Autowired
  public void setMovieCatalogs(Set&lt;MovieCatalog&gt; movieCatalogs) {
      this.movieCatalogs = movieCatalogs;
  }

  <lineannotation>// ...</lineannotation>
}</programlisting>

    <para>Even typed Maps can be autowired as long as the expected key type is
      <classname>String</classname>. The Map values will contain all beans of
      the expected type, and the keys will contain the corresponding bean
      names:</para>

    <programlisting language="java">public class MovieRecommender {

  private Map&lt;String, MovieCatalog&gt; movieCatalogs;

  @Autowired
  public void setMovieCatalogs(Map&lt;String, MovieCatalog&gt; movieCatalogs) {
      this.movieCatalogs = movieCatalogs;
  }

  <lineannotation>// ...</lineannotation>
}</programlisting>

    <para>By default, the autowiring fails whenever <emphasis>zero</emphasis>
      candidate beans are available; the default behavior is to treat annotated
      methods, constructors, and fields as indicating
      <emphasis>required</emphasis> dependencies. This behavior can be changed
      as demonstrated below.</para>

    <programlisting language="java">public class SimpleMovieLister {

  private MovieFinder movieFinder;

  @Autowired(required=false)
  public void setMovieFinder(MovieFinder movieFinder) {
      this.movieFinder = movieFinder;
  }

  <lineannotation>// ...</lineannotation>
}</programlisting>

    <note>
      <para>Only <emphasis>one annotated constructor per-class</emphasis> can be
        marked as <emphasis>required</emphasis>, but multiple non-required
        constructors can be annotated. In that case, each is considered among
        the candidates and Spring uses the <emphasis>greediest</emphasis>
        constructor whose dependencies can be satisfied, that is the constructor
        that has the largest number of arguments.</para>

      <para><interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename>'s
        <emphasis>required</emphasis> attribute is recommended over the
        <interfacename>@Required</interfacename> annotation. The
        <emphasis>required</emphasis> attribute indicates that the property is
        not required for autowiring purposes, the property is ignored if it
        cannot be autowired. <interfacename>@Required</interfacename>, on the
        other hand, is stronger in that it enforces the property that was set by
        any means supported by the container. If no value is injected, a
        corresponding exception is raised.</para>
    </note>

    <para>You can also use <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> for
      interfaces that are well-known resolvable dependencies:
      <interfacename>BeanFactory</interfacename>,
      <interfacename>ApplicationContext</interfacename>,
      <interfacename>Environment</interfacename>,
      <interfacename>ResourceLoader</interfacename>,
      <interfacename>ApplicationEventPublisher</interfacename>, and
      <interfacename>MessageSource</interfacename>. These interfaces and their
      extended interfaces, such as
      <interfacename>ConfigurableApplicationContext</interfacename> or
      <interfacename>ResourcePatternResolver</interfacename>, are automatically
      resolved, with no special setup necessary.</para>

    <programlisting language="java">public class MovieRecommender {

  @Autowired
  private ApplicationContext context;

  public MovieRecommender() {
  }

  <lineannotation>// ...</lineannotation>
}</programlisting>

    <note>
      <para>
        <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename>,
        <interfacename>@Inject</interfacename>,
        <interfacename>@Resource</interfacename>, and
        <interfacename>@Value</interfacename> annotations are handled by a
        Spring <interfacename>BeanPostProcessor</interfacename> implementations
        which in turn means that you <emphasis>cannot</emphasis>
        apply these annotations within your own
        <classname>BeanPostProcessor</classname> or
        <classname>BeanFactoryPostProcessor</classname> types (if any). These
        types must be 'wired up' explicitly via XML or using a Spring
        <interfacename>@Bean</interfacename> method.</para>

  <section xml:id="beans-autowired-annotation-qualifiers">
    <title>Fine-tuning annotation-based autowiring with qualifiers</title>

    <para>Because autowiring by type may lead to multiple candidates, it is
      often necessary to have more control over the selection process. One way
      to accomplish this is with Spring's
      <interfacename>@Qualifier</interfacename> annotation. You can associate
      qualifier values with specific arguments, narrowing the set of type
      matches so that a specific bean is chosen for each argument. In the
      simplest case, this can be a plain descriptive value:</para>

    <programlisting language="java">public class MovieRecommender {

  @Autowired
  <emphasis role="bold">@Qualifier("main")</emphasis>
  private MovieCatalog movieCatalog;

  <lineannotation>// ...</lineannotation>
}</programlisting>

    <para>The <interfacename>@Qualifier</interfacename> annotation can also be
      specified on individual constructor arguments or method parameters:</para>

    <programlisting language="java">public class MovieRecommender {

  private MovieCatalog movieCatalog;

  private CustomerPreferenceDao customerPreferenceDao;

  @Autowired
  public void prepare(<emphasis role="bold">@Qualifier("main")</emphasis> MovieCatalog movieCatalog,
                      CustomerPreferenceDao customerPreferenceDao) {
      this.movieCatalog = movieCatalog;
      this.customerPreferenceDao = customerPreferenceDao;
  }

  <lineannotation>// ...</lineannotation>
}</programlisting>

    <para>The corresponding bean definitions appear as follows. The bean with
      qualifier value "main" is wired with the constructor argument that is
      qualified with the same value.</para>

    <programlisting language="xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
      http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd
      http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
      http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context-3.0.xsd"&gt;

  &lt;context:annotation-config/&gt;

  &lt;bean class="example.SimpleMovieCatalog"&gt;
      <emphasis role="bold">&lt;qualifier value="main"/&gt;</emphasis>
      <lineannotation>&lt;!-- inject any dependencies required by this bean --&gt;</lineannotation>
  &lt;/bean&gt;

  &lt;bean class="example.SimpleMovieCatalog"&gt;
      <emphasis role="bold">&lt;qualifier value="action"/&gt;</emphasis>
      <lineannotation>&lt;!-- inject any dependencies required by this bean --&gt;</lineannotation>
  &lt;/bean&gt;

  &lt;bean id="movieRecommender" class="example.MovieRecommender"/&gt;

&lt;/beans&gt;
</programlisting>

    <para>For a fallback match, the bean name is considered a default qualifier
      value. Thus you can define the bean with an id "main" instead of the
      nested qualifier element, leading to the same matching result. However,
      although you can use this convention to refer to specific beans by name,
      <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> is fundamentally about
      type-driven injection with optional semantic qualifiers. This means that
      qualifier values, even with the bean name fallback, always have narrowing
      semantics within the set of type matches; they do not semantically express
      a reference to a unique bean id. Good qualifier values are "main" or
      "EMEA" or "persistent", expressing characteristics of a specific component
      that are independent from the bean id, which may be auto-generated in case
      of an anonymous bean definition like the one in the preceding
      example.</para>

    <para>Qualifiers also apply to typed collections, as discussed above, for
      example, to <literal>Set&lt;MovieCatalog&gt;</literal>. In this case, all
      matching beans according to the declared qualifiers are injected as a
      collection. This implies that qualifiers do not have to be unique; they
      rather simply constitute filtering criteria. For example, you can define
      multiple <classname>MovieCatalog</classname> beans with the same qualifier
      value "action"; all of which would be injected into a
      <literal>Set&lt;MovieCatalog&gt;</literal> annotated with
      <literal>@Qualifier("action")</literal>.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>If you intend to express annotation-driven injection by name, do not
        primarily use <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename>, even if is
        technically capable of referring to a bean name through
        <interfacename>@Qualifier</interfacename> values. Instead, use the
        JSR-250 <interfacename>@Resource</interfacename> annotation, which is
        semantically defined to identify a specific target component by its
        unique name, with the declared type being irrelevant for the matching
        process.</para>

      <para>As a specific consequence of this semantic difference, beans that
        are themselves defined as a collection or map type cannot be injected
        through <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename>, because type matching
        is not properly applicable to them. Use
        <interfacename>@Resource</interfacename> for such beans, referring to
        the specific collection or map bean by unique name.</para>

      <para><interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> applies to fields,
        constructors, and multi-argument methods, allowing for narrowing through
        qualifier annotations at the parameter level. By contrast,
        <interfacename>@Resource</interfacename> is supported only for fields
        and bean property setter methods with a single argument. As a
        consequence, stick with qualifiers if your injection target is a
        constructor or a multi-argument method.</para>
    </tip>

    <para>You can create your own custom qualifier annotations. Simply define an
      annotation and provide the <interfacename>@Qualifier</interfacename>
      annotation within your definition:</para>


    <programlisting language="java">@Target({ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.PARAMETER})
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
<emphasis role="bold">@Qualifier</emphasis>
public @interface Genre {

  String value();
}</programlisting>

    <para>Then you can provide the custom qualifier on autowired fields and
      parameters:</para>

    <programlisting language="java">public class MovieRecommender {

  @Autowired
  <emphasis role="bold">@Genre("Action")</emphasis>
  private MovieCatalog actionCatalog;

  private MovieCatalog comedyCatalog;

  @Autowired
  public void setComedyCatalog(<emphasis role="bold">@Genre("Comedy")</emphasis> MovieCatalog comedyCatalog) {
      this.comedyCatalog = comedyCatalog;
  }

  <lineannotation>// ...</lineannotation>
}</programlisting>

    <para>Next, provide the information for the candidate bean definitions. You
      can add <literal>&lt;qualifier/&gt;</literal> tags as sub-elements of the
      <literal>&lt;bean/&gt;</literal> tag and then specify the
      <literal>type</literal> and <literal>value</literal> to match your custom
      qualifier annotations. The type is matched against the fully-qualified
      class name of the annotation. Or, as a convenience if no risk of
      conflicting names exists, you can use the short class name. Both
      approaches are demonstrated in the following example.</para>

    <programlisting language="xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
      http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd
      http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
      http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context-3.0.xsd"&gt;

  &lt;context:annotation-config/&gt;

  &lt;bean class="example.SimpleMovieCatalog"&gt;
      <emphasis role="bold">&lt;qualifier type="Genre" value="Action"/&gt;</emphasis>
      <lineannotation>&lt;!-- inject any dependencies required by this bean --&gt;</lineannotation>
  &lt;/bean&gt;

  &lt;bean class="example.SimpleMovieCatalog"&gt;
      <emphasis role="bold">&lt;qualifier type="example.Genre" value="Comedy"/&gt;</emphasis>
      <lineannotation>&lt;!-- inject any dependencies required by this bean --&gt;</lineannotation>
  &lt;/bean&gt;

  &lt;bean id="movieRecommender" class="example.MovieRecommender"/&gt;

&lt;/beans&gt;
</programlisting>

    <para>In <xref linkend="beans-classpath-scanning"/>, you will see an
      annotation-based alternative to providing the qualifier metadata in XML.
      Specifically, see <xref linkend="beans-scanning-qualifiers"/>.</para>

    <para>In some cases, it may be sufficient to use an annotation without a
      value. This may be useful when the annotation serves a more generic
      purpose and can be applied across several different types of dependencies.
      For example, you may provide an <emphasis>offline</emphasis> catalog that
      would be searched when no Internet connection is available. First define
      the simple annotation:</para>

    <programlisting language="java">@Target({ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.PARAMETER})
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Qualifier
public @interface Offline {

}</programlisting>

    <para>Then add the annotation to the field or property to be
      autowired:</para>

    <programlisting language="java">public class MovieRecommender {

  @Autowired
  <emphasis role="bold">@Offline</emphasis>
  private MovieCatalog offlineCatalog;

  <lineannotation>// ...</lineannotation>
}</programlisting>

    <para>Now the bean definition only needs a qualifier
      <literal>type</literal>:</para>

    <programlisting language="xml">&lt;bean class="example.SimpleMovieCatalog"&gt;
  <emphasis role="bold">&lt;qualifier type="Offline"/&gt;</emphasis>
  <lineannotation>&lt;!-- inject any dependencies required by this bean --&gt;</lineannotation>
&lt;/bean&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>You can also define custom qualifier annotations that accept named
      attributes in addition to or instead of the simple
      <literal>value</literal> attribute. If multiple attribute values are then
      specified on a field or parameter to be autowired, a bean definition must
      match <emphasis>all</emphasis> such attribute values to be considered an
      autowire candidate. As an example, consider the following annotation
      definition:</para>

    <programlisting language="java">@Target({ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.PARAMETER})
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Qualifier
public @interface MovieQualifier {

  String genre();

  Format format();
}</programlisting>

    <para>In this case <literal>Format</literal> is an enum:</para>

    <programlisting language="java">public enum Format {

  VHS, DVD, BLURAY
}</programlisting>

    <para>The fields to be autowired are annotated with the custom qualifier and
      include values for both attributes: <literal>genre</literal> and
      <literal>format</literal>.</para>

    <programlisting language="java">public class MovieRecommender {

  @Autowired
  @MovieQualifier(format=Format.VHS, genre="Action")
  private MovieCatalog actionVhsCatalog;

  @Autowired
  @MovieQualifier(format=Format.VHS, genre="Comedy")
  private MovieCatalog comedyVhsCatalog;

  @Autowired
  @MovieQualifier(format=Format.DVD, genre="Action")
  private MovieCatalog actionDvdCatalog;

  @Autowired
  @MovieQualifier(format=Format.BLURAY, genre="Comedy")
  private MovieCatalog comedyBluRayCatalog;

  <lineannotation>// ...</lineannotation>
}</programlisting>

    <para>Finally, the bean definitions should contain matching qualifier
      values. This example also demonstrates that bean <emphasis>meta</emphasis>
      attributes may be used instead of the
      <literal>&lt;qualifier/&gt;</literal> sub-elements. If available, the
      <literal>&lt;qualifier/&gt;</literal> and its attributes take precedence,
      but the autowiring mechanism falls back on the values provided within the

    <para>The <link
      xl:href="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/current/api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/CustomAutowireConfigurer.html"
      ><classname>CustomAutowireConfigurer</classname></link> is a
      <interfacename>BeanFactoryPostProcessor</interfacename> that enables you
      to register your own custom qualifier annotation types even if they are
      not annotated with Spring's <interfacename>@Qualifier</interfacename>
      annotation.</para>

    <programlisting language="xml">&lt;bean id="customAutowireConfigurer"
     class="org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.CustomAutowireConfigurer"&gt;
  &lt;property name="customQualifierTypes"&gt;
      &lt;set&gt;
          &lt;value&gt;example.CustomQualifier&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;/set&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>The particular implementation of
      <interfacename>AutowireCandidateResolver</interfacename> that is activated
      for the application context depends on the Java version. In versions
      earlier than Java 5, the qualifier annotations are not supported, and
      therefore autowire candidates are solely determined by the
      <literal>autowire-candidate</literal> value of each bean definition as
      well as by any <literal>default-autowire-candidates</literal> pattern(s)
      available on the <literal>&lt;beans/&gt;</literal> element. In Java 5 or
      later, the presence of <interfacename>@Qualifier</interfacename>
      annotations and any custom annotations registered with the
      <classname>CustomAutowireConfigurer</classname> will also play a
      role.</para>

    <para>Regardless of the Java version, when multiple beans qualify as
      autowire candidates, the determination of a "primary" candidate is the
      same: if exactly one bean definition among the candidates has a
      <literal>primary</literal> attribute set to <literal>true</literal>, it
      will be selected.</para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="beans-resource-annotation">
    <title><interfacename>@Resource</interfacename></title>

    <para>Spring also supports injection using the JSR-250
      <interfacename>@Resource</interfacename> annotation on fields or bean
      property setter methods. This is a common pattern in Java EE 5 and 6, for
      example in JSF 1.2 managed beans or JAX-WS 2.0 endpoints. Spring supports
      this pattern for Spring-managed objects as well.</para>

    <para><interfacename>@Resource</interfacename> takes a name attribute, and
      by default Spring interprets that value as the bean name to be injected.
      In other words, it follows <emphasis>by-name</emphasis> semantics, as
      demonstrated in this example:</para>

    <programlisting language="java">public class SimpleMovieLister {

  private MovieFinder movieFinder;

  <emphasis role="bold">@Resource(name="myMovieFinder")</emphasis>
  public void setMovieFinder(MovieFinder movieFinder) {
      this.movieFinder = movieFinder;
  }
}</programlisting>

    <para>If no name is specified explicitly, the default name is derived from
      the field name or setter method. In case of a field, it takes the field
      name; in case of a setter method, it takes the bean property name. So the
      following example is going to have the bean with name "movieFinder"
      injected into its setter method:</para>

    <programlisting language="java">public class SimpleMovieLister {

  private MovieFinder movieFinder;

  <emphasis role="bold">@Resource</emphasis>
  public void setMovieFinder(MovieFinder movieFinder) {
      this.movieFinder = movieFinder;
  }
}</programlisting>

    <note>
      <para>The name provided with the annotation is resolved as a bean name by
        the <interfacename>ApplicationContext</interfacename> of which the
        <classname>CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor</classname> is aware. The
        names can be resolved through JNDI if you configure Spring's <link
        xl:href="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/current/api/org/springframework/jndi/support/SimpleJndiBeanFactory.html"
        ><classname>SimpleJndiBeanFactory</classname></link> explicitly.
        However, it is recommended that you rely on the default behavior and
        simply use Spring's JNDI lookup capabilities to preserve the level of
        indirection.</para>
    </note>

    <para>In the exclusive case of <interfacename>@Resource</interfacename>
      usage with no explicit name specified, and similar to
      <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename>,
      <interfacename>@Resource</interfacename> finds a primary type match
      instead of a specific named bean and resolves well-known resolvable
      dependencies: the
      <interfacename>BeanFactory</interfacename><interfacename>,
      ApplicationContext,</interfacename><interfacename> ResourceLoader,
      ApplicationEventPublisher</interfacename>, and
      <interfacename>MessageSource</interfacename> interfaces.</para>

    <para>Thus in the following example, the
      <literal>customerPreferenceDao</literal> field first looks for a bean
      named customerPreferenceDao, then falls back to a primary type match for
      the type <classname>CustomerPreferenceDao</classname>. The "context" field
      is injected based on the known resolvable dependency type
      <interfacename>ApplicationContext</interfacename>.</para>

    <programlisting language="java">public class MovieRecommender {

  @Resource
  private CustomerPreferenceDao customerPreferenceDao;

  @Resource
  private ApplicationContext context;

  public MovieRecommender() {
  }

  <lineannotation>// ...</lineannotation>

  <section xml:id="beans-postconstruct-and-predestroy-annotations">
    <title><interfacename>@PostConstruct</interfacename> and
      <interfacename>@PreDestroy</interfacename></title>

    <para>The <classname>CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor</classname> not only
      recognizes the <interfacename>@Resource</interfacename> annotation but
      also the JSR-250 <emphasis>lifecycle</emphasis> annotations. Introduced in
      Spring 2.5, the support for these annotations offers yet another
      alternative to those described in <link
      linkend="beans-factory-lifecycle-initializingbean">initialization
      callbacks</link> and <link
      linkend="beans-factory-lifecycle-disposablebean">destruction
      callbacks</link>. Provided that the
      <classname>CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor</classname> is registered
      within the Spring <interfacename>ApplicationContext</interfacename>, a
      method carrying one of these annotations is invoked at the same point in
      the lifecycle as the corresponding Spring lifecycle interface method or
      explicitly declared callback method. In the example below, the cache will
      be pre-populated upon initialization and cleared upon destruction.</para>

    <programlisting language="java">public class CachingMovieLister {

  @PostConstruct
  public void populateMovieCache() {
      <lineannotation>// populates the movie cache upon initialization...</lineannotation>
  }

  @PreDestroy
  public void clearMovieCache() {
      <lineannotation>// clears the movie cache upon destruction...</lineannotation>
  }
}</programlisting>
