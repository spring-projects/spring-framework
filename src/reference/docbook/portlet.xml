      <title>JSR-168 The Java Portlet Specification</title>
      <para>For more general information about portlet development, please
      review a whitepaper from Sun entitled
      <ulink url="http://developers.sun.com/prodtech/portalserver/reference/techart/jsr168/">"Introduction to JSR 168"</ulink>,
      and of course the
      <ulink url="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr168/">JSR-168 Specification</ulink> itself.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>In addition to supporting conventional (servlet-based) Web development,
    Spring also supports JSR-168 Portlet development. As much as possible, the
    Portlet MVC framework is a mirror image of the Web MVC framework, and also
    uses the same underlying view abstractions and integration technology. So, be
    sure to review the chapters entitled <xref linkend="mvc"/> and
    <xref linkend="view"/> before continuing with this chapter.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Bear in mind that while the concepts of Spring MVC are the
      same in Spring Portlet MVC, there are some notable differences
      created by the unique workflow of JSR-168 portlets.</para>
    </note>

    <para>The main way in which portlet workflow differs from servlet
    workflow is that the request to the portlet can have two distinct
    phases: the action phase and the render phase. The action phase is
    executed only once and is where any 'backend' changes or actions occur,
    such as making changes in a database. The render phase then produces
    what is displayed to the user each time the display is refreshed.
    The critical point here is that for a single overall request, the action
    phase is executed only once, but the render phase may be executed
    multiple times. This provides (and requires) a clean separation between
    the activities that modify the persistent state of your system and the
    activities that generate what is displayed to the user.</para>

    <!-- insert some content about Spring Web Flow here -->
    <xi:include href="swf-sidebar.xml"/>

    <para>The dual phases of portlet requests are one of the real strengths
    of the JSR-168 specification. For example, dynamic search results can be
    updated routinely on the display without the user explicitly rerunning
    the search. Most other portlet MVC frameworks attempt to completely
    hide the two phases from the developer and make it look as much like
    traditional servlet development as possible - we think this
    approach removes one of the main benefits of using portlets. So, the
    separation of the two phases is preserved throughout the Spring Portlet
    MVC framework. The primary manifestation of this approach is that where
    the servlet version of the MVC classes will have one method that deals
    with the request, the portlet version of the MVC classes will have two
    methods that deal with the request: one for the action phase and one for
    the render phase. For example, where the servlet version of
    <classname>AbstractController</classname> has the
    <methodname>handleRequestInternal(..)</methodname> method, the portlet
    version of <classname>AbstractController</classname> has
    <methodname>handleActionRequestInternal(..)</methodname> and
    <methodname>handleRenderRequestInternal(..)</methodname> methods.</para>

    <para>The framework is designed around a
    <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname> that dispatches requests to
    handlers, with configurable handler mappings and view resolution, just
    as the <classname>DispatcherServlet</classname> in the web framework
    does. File upload is also supported in the same way.</para>

    <para>Locale resolution and theme resolution are not supported in
    Portlet MVC - these areas are in the purview of the
    portal/portlet container and are not appropriate at the Spring level.
    However, all mechanisms in Spring that depend on the locale (such as
    internationalization of messages) will still function properly because
    <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname> exposes the current locale in
    the same way as <classname>DispatcherServlet</classname>.</para>

    <section id="portlet-introduction-controller">
      <title>Controllers - The C in MVC</title>
      <para>The default handler is still a very simple
      <interfacename>Controller</interfacename> interface, offering just two
      methods:</para>

        <listitem>

        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>The framework also includes most of the same controller
      implementation hierarchy, such as <classname>AbstractController</classname>,
      <classname>SimpleFormController</classname>, and so on. Data binding,
      command object usage, model handling, and view resolution are all the
      same as in the servlet framework.</para>

    <section id="portlet-introduction-view">
      <title>Views - The V in MVC</title>
      <para>All the view rendering capabilities of the servlet framework are
      used directly via a special bridge servlet named
      <classname>ViewRendererServlet</classname>. By using this servlet, the
      portlet request is converted into a servlet request and the view can be
      rendered using the entire normal servlet infrastructure. This means all
      the existing renderers, such as JSP, Velocity, etc., can still be used
      within the portlet.</para>

      <para>Spring Portlet MVC supports beans whose lifecycle is scoped to the
      current HTTP request or HTTP <interfacename>Session</interfacename> (both
      normal and global). This is not a specific feature of Spring Portlet MVC
      itself, but rather of the <interfacename>WebApplicationContext</interfacename>

      in detail in <xref linkend="beans-factory-scopes-other"/></para>

    <title>The <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname></title>

    <para>Portlet MVC is a request-driven web MVC framework, designed around
    a portlet that dispatches requests to controllers and offers other
    functionality facilitating the development of portlet applications.
    Spring's <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname> however, does more
    than just that. It is completely integrated with the Spring
    <interfacename>ApplicationContext</interfacename> and allows you to use
    every other feature Spring has.</para>

    <para>Like ordinary portlets, the
    <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname> is declared in the
    <literal>portlet.xml</literal> file of your web application:</para>

    <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<portlet>
    <portlet-name>sample</portlet-name>
    <portlet-class>org.springframework.web.portlet.DispatcherPortlet</portlet-class>

    </supports>
    <portlet-info>
        <title>Sample Portlet</title>
    </portlet-info>
</portlet>]]></programlisting>

    <para>The <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname> now needs to be
    configured.</para>

    <para>In the Portlet MVC framework, each
    <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname> has its own
    <interfacename>WebApplicationContext</interfacename>, which inherits all
    the beans already defined in the Root
    <interfacename>WebApplicationContext</interfacename>. These inherited
    beans can be overridden in the portlet-specific scope, and new
    scope-specific beans can be defined local to a given portlet instance.</para>

    <para>The framework will, on initialization of a
    <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname>, look for a file named
    <literal>[portlet-name]-portlet.xml</literal> in the <literal>WEB-INF</literal>
    directory of your web application and create the beans defined there
    (overriding the definitions of any beans defined with the same name in
    the global scope).</para>

    <para>The config location used by the
    <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname> can be modified through a
    portlet initialization parameter (see below for details).</para>

    <para>The Spring <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname> has a few
    special beans it uses, in order to be able to process requests and
    render the appropriate views. These beans are included in the Spring
    framework and can be configured in the
    <interfacename>WebApplicationContext</interfacename>, just as any other
    bean would be configured. Each of those beans is described in more
    detail below. Right now, we'll just mention them, just to let you know
    they exist and to enable us to go on talking about the
    <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname>. For most of the beans,
    defaults are provided so you don't have to worry about configuring
    them.</para>

    <para>When a <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname> is setup for use
    and a request comes in for that specific
    <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname>, it starts processing the

    through if handled by a <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname>:</para>

    <orderedlist>

      <listitem><para>The locale returned by
      <literal>PortletRequest.getLocale()</literal> is bound to the

      etc.).</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>If a multipart resolver is specified and this is an
      <interfacename>ActionRequest</interfacename>, the request is

      multipart handling).</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>An appropriate handler is searched for. If a handler

      <listitem><para>If a model is returned, the view is rendered, using
      the view resolver that has been configured with the

      intercepting the request, for example, for security reasons), no

    <para>The rendering process in Portlet MVC is a bit more complex than in

    exists for just this purpose: the
    <classname>ViewRendererServlet</classname>.</para>

    <para>In order for <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname> rendering to
    work, you must declare an instance of the

    <para>As you can see, the Portlet

    the render request. The action phase should be capable of handling an
    action request, and the render phase should be capable of handling a
    render request and returning an appropriate model and view. While the
    <interfacename>Controller</interfacename> interface is quite abstract,
    Spring Portlet MVC offers several controllers that already contain a
    lot of the functionality you might need; most of these are very similar
    to controllers from Spring Web MVC. The
    <interfacename>Controller</interfacename> interface just defines the
    most common functionality required of every controller: handling an

              specify a positive integer here. By default it is

              the default caching. Setting it to <literal>0</literal>

      <para>The <literal>requireSession</literal> and

      <classname>PortletContentGenerator</classname> class, which is the
      superclass of <classname>AbstractController</classname>) but are
      included here for completeness.</para>

      <para>When using the <classname>AbstractController</classname> as a
      baseclass for your controllers (which is not recommended since there
      are a lot of other controllers that might already do the job for
      you) you only have to override either the
      <methodname>handleActionRequestInternal(ActionRequest,
      ActionResponse)</methodname> method or the
      <methodname>handleRenderRequestInternal(RenderRequest,
      RenderResponse)</methodname> method (or both), implement your logic,
      and return a <classname>ModelAndView</classname> object (in the case
      of <literal>handleRenderRequestInternal</literal>).</para>

      <para>The default implementations of both
      <methodname>handleActionRequestInternal(..)</methodname> and
      <methodname>handleRenderRequestInternal(..)</methodname> throw a
      <classname>PortletException</classname>. This is consistent with
      the behavior of <classname>GenericPortlet</classname> from the JSR-
      168 Specification API. So you only need to override the method that
      your controller is intended to handle.</para>

      <para>Here is short example consisting of a class and a declaration
      in the web application context.</para>

      <para>The class above and the declaration in the web application

      <title>Other simple controllers</title>

      <para>Although you can extend <classname>AbstractController</classname>,
      Spring Portlet MVC provides a number of concrete implementations which offer
      functionality that is commonly used in simple MVC applications.</para>

      <para>The <classname>ParameterizableViewController</classname> is
      basically the same as the example above, except for the fact that

      <para>The <classname>PortletModeNameViewController</classname> uses
      the current mode of the portlet as the view name. So, if your
      portlet is in View mode (i.e. <literal>PortletMode.VIEW</literal>)
      then it uses "view" as the view name.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="portlet-controller-command">
      <title>Command Controllers</title>

      <para>Spring Portlet MVC has the exact same hierarchy of
      <emphasis>command controllers</emphasis> as Spring Web MVC. They
      provide a way to interact with data objects and dynamically bind
      parameters from the <interfacename>PortletRequest</interfacename> to
      the data object specified. Your data objects don't have to
      implement a framework-specific interface, so you can directly
      manipulate your persistent objects if you desire. Let's examine what
      command controllers are available, to get an overview of what you can do
      with them:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para><classname>AbstractCommandController</classname>
        - a command controller you can use to create your own command
        controller, capable of binding request parameters to a data
        object you specify. This class does not offer form
        functionality, it does however offer validation features and
        lets you specify in the controller itself what to do with the
        command object that has been filled with the parameters from the
        request.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para><classname>AbstractFormController</classname> -
        an abstract controller offering form submission support. Using
        this controller you can model forms and populate them using a
        command object you retrieve in the controller. After a user has
        filled the form, <classname>AbstractFormController</classname>
        binds the fields, validates, and hands the object back to the
        controller to take appropriate action. Supported features are:
        invalid form submission (resubmission), validation, and normal
        form workflow. You implement methods to determine which views
        are used for form presentation and success. Use this controller
        if you need forms, but don't want to specify what views you're
        going to show the user in the application
        context.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para><classname>SimpleFormController</classname> - a
        concrete <classname>AbstractFormController</classname> that
        provides even more support when creating a form with a
        corresponding command object. The
        <classname>SimpleFormController</classname> lets you specify a
        command object, a viewname for the form, a viewname for the page you
        want to show the user when form submission has succeeded, and
        more.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para><classname>AbstractWizardFormController</classname> –
        a concrete <classname>AbstractFormController</classname> that
        provides a wizard-style interface for editing the contents of a
        command object across multiple display pages. Supports multiple
        user actions: finish, cancel, or page change, all of which are
        easily specified in request parameters from the
        view.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>These command controllers are quite powerful, but they do
      require a detailed understanding of how they operate in order to use
      them efficiently. Carefully review the Javadocs for this entire
      hierarchy and then look at some sample implementations before you
      start using them.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="portlet-controller-wrapping">
      <title><classname>PortletWrappingController</classname></title>

      <para>Instead of developing new controllers, it is possible to use
      existing portlets and map requests to them from a
      <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname>. Using the
      <classname>PortletWrappingController</classname>, you can
      instantiate an existing <interfacename>Portlet</interfacename> as a
      <interfacename>Controller</interfacename> as follows:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bean id="myPortlet" class="org.springframework.web.portlet.mvc.PortletWrappingController">
    <property name="portletClass" value="sample.MyPortlet"/>
    <property name="portletName" value="my-portlet"/>
    <property name="initParameters">
        <value>config=/WEB-INF/my-portlet-config.xml</value>
    </property>
</bean>]]></programlisting>

      <para>This can be very valuable since you can then use interceptors
      to pre-process and post-process requests going to these portlets.
      Since JSR-168 does not support any kind of filter mechanism, this is
      quite handy. For example, this can be used to wrap the Hibernate
      <classname>OpenSessionInViewInterceptor</classname> around a MyFaces
      JSF Portlet.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section id="portlet-handlermapping">
    <title>Handler mappings</title>

    <para>Using a handler mapping you can map incoming portlet requests to
    appropriate handlers. There are some handler mappings you can use out
    of the box, for example, the
    <classname>PortletModeHandlerMapping</classname>, but let's first
    examine the general concept of a
    <interfacename>HandlerMapping</interfacename>.</para>

    <para>Note: We are intentionally using the term “Handler” here instead
    of “Controller”. <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname> is designed
    to be used with other ways to process requests than just Spring Portlet
    MVC’s own Controllers. A Handler is any Object that can handle portlet
    requests. Controllers are an example of Handlers, and they are of
    course the default. To use some other framework with
    <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname>, a corresponding implementation
    of <interfacename>HandlerAdapter</interfacename> is all that is needed.</para>

    <para>The functionality a basic
    <interfacename>HandlerMapping</interfacename> provides is the delivering
    of a <classname>HandlerExecutionChain</classname>, which must contain
    the handler that matches the incoming request, and may also contain a
    list of handler interceptors that are applied to the request. When a
    request comes in, the <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname> will hand
    it over to the handler mapping to let it inspect the request and come up
    with an appropriate <classname>HandlerExecutionChain</classname>. Then
    the <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname> will execute the handler
    and interceptors in the chain (if any). These concepts are all exactly
    the same as in Spring Web MVC.</para>

    <para>The concept of configurable handler mappings that can optionally
    contain interceptors (executed before or after the actual handler was
    executed, or both) is extremely powerful. A lot of supporting
    functionality can be built into a custom
    <interfacename>HandlerMapping</interfacename>. Think of a custom handler
    mapping that chooses a handler not only based on the portlet mode of the
    request coming in, but also on a specific state of the session
    associated with the request.</para>

    <para>In Spring Web MVC, handler mappings are commonly based on URLs.
    Since there is really no such thing as a URL within a Portlet, we must
    use other mechanisms to control mappings. The two most common are the
    portlet mode and a request parameter, but anything available to the
    portlet request can be used in a custom handler mapping.</para>

    <para>The rest of this section describes three of Spring Portlet MVC's
    most commonly used handler mappings. They all extend
    <classname>AbstractHandlerMapping</classname> and share the following
    properties:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para><literal>interceptors</literal>: The list of
      interceptors to use.
      <interfacename>HandlerInterceptor</interfacename>s are discussed in
      <xref linkend="portlet-handlermapping-interceptor"/>.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><literal>defaultHandler</literal>: The default
      handler to use, when this handler mapping does not result in a
      matching handler.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><literal>order</literal>: Based on the value of the
      order property (see the
      <interfacename>org.springframework.core.Ordered</interfacename>
      interface), Spring will sort all handler mappings available in the
      context and apply the first matching handler.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><literal>lazyInitHandlers</literal>: Allows for lazy
      initialization of singleton handlers (prototype handlers are always
      lazily initialized). Default value is false. This property is
      directly implemented in the three concrete
      Handlers.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <section id="portlet-handlermapping-portletmode">
      <title><classname>PortletModeHandlerMapping</classname></title>

      <para>This is a simple handler mapping that maps incoming requests
      based on the current mode of the portlet (e.g. ‘view’, ‘edit’,
      ‘help’). An example:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bean class="org.springframework.web.portlet.handler.PortletModeHandlerMapping">
    <property name="portletModeMap">
        <map>
            <entry key="view" value-ref="viewHandler"/>
            <entry key="edit" value-ref="editHandler"/>
            <entry key="help" value-ref="helpHandler"/>
        </map>
    </property>
</bean>]]></programlisting>
    </section>

    <section id="portlet-handlermapping-parameter">
      <title><classname>ParameterHandlerMapping</classname></title>

      <para>If we need to navigate around to multiple controllers without
      changing portlet mode, the simplest way to do this is with a request
      parameter that is used as the key to control the mapping.</para>

      <para><classname>ParameterHandlerMapping</classname> uses the value
      of a specific request parameter to control the mapping. The default
      name of the parameter is <literal>'action'</literal>, but can be changed
      using the <literal>'parameterName'</literal> property.</para>

      <para>The bean configuration for this mapping will look something
      like this:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bean class="org.springframework.web.portlet.handler.ParameterHandlerMapping”>
    <property name="parameterMap">
        <map>
            <entry key="add" value-ref="addItemHandler"/>
            <entry key="edit" value-ref="editItemHandler"/>
            <entry key="delete" value-ref="deleteItemHandler"/>
        </map>
    </property>
</bean>]]></programlisting>
    </section>

    <section id="portlet-handlermapping-portletmodeparameter">
      <title><classname>PortletModeParameterHandlerMapping</classname></title>

      <para>The most powerful built-in handler mapping,
      <classname>PortletModeParameterHandlerMapping</classname> combines
      the capabilities of the two previous ones to allow different
      navigation within each portlet mode.</para>

      <para>Again the default name of the parameter is "action", but can
      be changed using the <literal>parameterName</literal>
      property.</para>

      <para>By default, the same parameter value may not be used in two
      different portlet modes. This is so that if the portal itself
      changes the portlet mode, the request will no longer be valid in the
      mapping. This behavior can be changed by setting the
      <literal>allowDupParameters</literal> property to true. However,
      this is not recommended.</para>

      <para>The bean configuration for this mapping will look something
      like this:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bean class="org.springframework.web.portlet.handler.PortletModeParameterHandlerMapping">
    <property name="portletModeParameterMap">
        <map>

                    <entry key="delete" value-ref="deleteItemHandler"/>
                </map>
            </entry>
            <entry key="edit"> ]]><lineannotation>&lt;!-- 'edit' portlet mode --&gt;</lineannotation><![CDATA[
                <map>
                    <entry key="prefs" value-ref="prefsHandler"/>
                    <entry key="resetPrefs" value-ref="resetPrefsHandler"/>
                </map>
            </entry>
        </map>
    </property>
</bean>]]></programlisting>

      <para>This mapping can be chained ahead of a
      <classname>PortletModeHandlerMapping</classname>, which can then provide
      defaults for each mode and an overall default as well.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="portlet-handlermapping-interceptor">
      <title>Adding <interfacename>HandlerInterceptor</interfacename>s</title>

      <para>Spring's handler mapping mechanism has a notion of handler
      interceptors, which can be extremely useful when you want to apply
      specific functionality to certain requests, for example, checking
      for a principal. Again Spring Portlet MVC implements these concepts
      in the same way as Web MVC.</para>

      <para>Interceptors located in the handler mapping must implement
      <interfacename>HandlerInterceptor</interfacename> from the
      <literal>org.springframework.web.portlet</literal> package. Just
      like the servlet version, this interface defines three methods: one
      that will be called before the actual handler will be executed
      (<literal>preHandle</literal>), one that will be called after the
      handler is executed (<literal>postHandle</literal>), and one that is
      called after the complete request has finished
      (<literal>afterCompletion</literal>). These three methods should
      provide enough flexibility to do all kinds of pre- and post-
      processing.</para>

      <para>The <literal>preHandle</literal> method returns a boolean
      value. You can use this method to break or continue the processing
      of the execution chain. When this method returns
      <literal>true</literal>, the handler execution chain will continue.
      When it returns <literal>false</literal>, the
      <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname> assumes the interceptor
      itself has taken care of requests (and, for example, rendered an
      appropriate view) and does not continue executing the other
      interceptors and the actual handler in the execution chain.</para>

      <para>The <literal>postHandle</literal> method is only called on a
      <interfacename>RenderRequest</interfacename>. The
      <literal>preHandle</literal> and <literal>afterCompletion</literal>
      methods are called on both an
      <interfacename>ActionRequest</interfacename> and a
      <interfacename>RenderRequest</interfacename>. If you need to
      execute logic in these methods for just one type of request, be sure
      to check what kind of request it is before processing it.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="portlet-handlermapping-interceptoradapter">
      <title><classname>HandlerInterceptorAdapter</classname></title>

      <para>As with the servlet package, the portlet package has a
      concrete implementation of
      <interfacename>HandlerInterceptor</interfacename> called
      <classname>HandlerInterceptorAdapter</classname>. This class has
      empty versions of all the methods so that you can inherit from this
      class and implement just one or two methods when that is all you
      need.</para>

    </section>

    <section id="portlet-handlermapping-parameterinterceptor">
      <title><classname>ParameterMappingInterceptor</classname></title>

      <para>The portlet package also has a concrete interceptor named
      <classname>ParameterMappingInterceptor</classname> that is meant to
      be used directly with <classname>ParameterHandlerMapping</classname>
      and <classname>PortletModeParameterHandlerMapping</classname>. This
      interceptor will cause the parameter that is being used to control
      the mapping to be forwarded from an
      <interfacename>ActionRequest</interfacename> to the subsequent
      <interfacename>RenderRequest</interfacename>. This will help ensure
      that the <interfacename>RenderRequest</interfacename> is mapped to
      the same Handler as the
      <interfacename>ActionRequest</interfacename>. This is done in the
      <literal>preHandle</literal> method of the interceptor, so you can
      still modify the parameter value in your handler to change where the
      <interfacename>RenderRequest</interfacename> will be mapped.</para>

      <para>Be aware that this interceptor is calling
      <literal>setRenderParameter</literal> on the
      <interfacename>ActionResponse</interfacename>, which means that you
      cannot call <literal>sendRedirect</literal> in your handler when
      using this interceptor. If you need to do external redirects then
      you will either need to forward the mapping parameter manually or
      write a different interceptor to handle this for you.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section id="portlet-viewresolver">
    <title>Views and resolving them</title>

    <para>As mentioned previously, Spring Portlet MVC directly reuses all
    the view technologies from Spring Web MVC. This includes not only the
    various <interfacename>View</interfacename> implementations themselves,
    but also the <interfacename>ViewResolver</interfacename> implementations.
    For more information, refer to <xref linkend="view"/> and
    <xref linkend="mvc-viewresolver"/> respectively.</para>

    <para>A few items on using the existing <interfacename>View</interfacename> and
    <interfacename>ViewResolver</interfacename> implementations  are worth mentioning:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Most portals expect the result of rendering a
      portlet to be an HTML fragment. So, things like JSP/JSTL, Velocity,
      FreeMarker, and XSLT all make sense. But it is unlikely that views
      that return other document types will make any sense in a portlet
      context.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>There is no such thing as an HTTP redirect from
      within a portlet (the <literal>sendRedirect(..)</literal> method of
      <interfacename>ActionResponse</interfacename> cannot
      be used to stay within the portal). So, <classname>RedirectView</classname>
      and use of the <literal>'redirect:'</literal> prefix will
      <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> work correctly from within Portlet MVC.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>It may be possible to use the <literal>'forward:'</literal> prefix from
      within Portlet MVC. However, remember that since you are in a
      portlet, you have no idea what the current URL looks like. This
      means you cannot use a relative URL to access other resources in
      your web application and that you will have to use an absolute
      URL.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Also, for JSP development, the new Spring Taglib and the new
    Spring Form Taglib both work in portlet views in exactly the same way
    that they work in servlet views.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="portlet-multipart">
    <title>Multipart (file upload) support</title>

    <para>Spring Portlet MVC has built-in multipart support to handle file
    uploads in portlet applications, just like Web MVC does. The design for
    the multipart support is done with pluggable
    <interfacename>PortletMultipartResolver</interfacename> objects, defined
    in the <literal>org.springframework.web.portlet.multipart</literal>
    package. Spring provides a <interfacename>PortletMultipartResolver</interfacename>
    for use with
    <ulink url="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/fileupload">Commons FileUpload</ulink>.
    How uploading files is supported will be described in the rest of this section.</para>

    <para>By default, no multipart handling will be done by Spring Portlet
    MVC, as some developers will want to handle multiparts themselves. You
    will have to enable it yourself by adding a multipart resolver to the
    web application's context. After you have done that,
    <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname> will inspect each request to
    see if it contains a multipart. If no multipart is found, the request
    will continue as expected. However, if a multipart is found in the
    request, the <interfacename>PortletMultipartResolver</interfacename>
    that has been declared in your context will be used. After that, the
    multipart attribute in your request will be treated like any other
    attribute.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Any configured <interfacename>PortletMultipartResolver</interfacename>
      bean <emphasis>must</emphasis> have the following id (or name):
      "<literal>portletMultipartResolver</literal>". If you have defined your
      <interfacename>PortletMultipartResolver</interfacename> with any other name,
      then the <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname> will <emphasis>not</emphasis>
      find your <interfacename>PortletMultipartResolver</interfacename>, and
      consequently no multipart support will be in effect.</para>

</bean>]]></programlisting>

      <para>Of course you also need to put the appropriate jars in your
      classpath for the multipart resolver to work. In the case of the
      <classname>CommonsMultipartResolver</classname>, you need to use
      <literal>commons-fileupload.jar</literal>. Be sure to use at least
      version 1.1 of Commons FileUpload as previous versions do not
      support JSR-168 Portlet applications.</para>

      <para>Now that you have seen how to set Portlet MVC up to handle
      multipart requests, let's talk about how to actually use it. When
      <classname>DispatcherPortlet</classname> detects a multipart
      request, it activates the resolver that has been declared in your
      context and hands over the request. What the resolver then does is
      wrap the current <interfacename>ActionRequest</interfacename> in a
      <interfacename>MultipartActionRequest</interfacename> that has
      support for multipart file uploads. Using the
      <interfacename>MultipartActionRequest</interfacename> you can get
      information about the multiparts contained by this request and
      actually get access to the multipart files themselves in your
      controllers.</para>

      <para>Note that you can only receive multipart file uploads as part
      of an <interfacename>ActionRequest</interfacename>, not as part of a
      <interfacename>RenderRequest</interfacename>.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="portlet-multipart-forms">
      <title>Handling a file upload in a form</title>

      <para>After the
      <interfacename>PortletMultipartResolver</interfacename> has finished
      doing its job, the request will be processed like any other. To use
      the <interfacename>PortletMultipartResolver</interfacename>, create
      a form with an upload field (see example below),
      then let Spring bind the file onto your form (backing object). To
      actually let the user upload a file, we have to create a (JSP/HTML)
      form:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<h1>Please upload a file</h1>
<form method="post" action="<portlet:actionURL/>" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type="file" name="file"/>
    <input type="submit"/>
</form>]]></programlisting>

      <para>As you can see, we've created a field named “file” that matches the
      property of the bean that holds the <literal>byte[]</literal> array.
      Furthermore we've added the encoding attribute
      (<literal>enctype="multipart/form-data"</literal>), which is
      necessary to let the browser know how to encode the multipart fields
      (do not forget this!).</para>

      <para>Just as with any other property that's not automagically
      convertible to a string or primitive type, to be able to put binary
      data in your objects you have to register a custom editor with the
      <classname>PortletRequestDataBinder</classname>. There are a couple
      of editors available for handling files and setting the results on
      an object. There's a
      <classname>StringMultipartFileEditor</classname> capable of
      converting files to Strings (using a user-defined character set), and
      there is a <classname>ByteArrayMultipartFileEditor</classname> which
      converts files to byte arrays. They function analogous to the
      <classname>CustomDateEditor</classname>.</para>

      <para>So, to be able to upload files using a form, declare the
      resolver, a mapping to a controller that will process the bean, and
      the controller itself.</para>

      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bean id="portletMultipartResolver"
        class="org.springframework.web.portlet.multipart.CommonsPortletMultipartResolver"/>

<bean class="org.springframework.web.portlet.handler.PortletModeHandlerMapping">
    <property name="portletModeMap">
        <map>

      <para>After that, create the controller and the actual class to hold
      the file property.</para>

      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public class FileUploadController extends SimpleFormController {

        this.file = file;
    }

    public byte[] getFile() {
        return file;
    }
}]]></programlisting>

      <para>As you can see, the <classname>FileUploadBean</classname> has
      a property of type <literal>byte[]</literal> that holds the file. The
      controller registers a custom editor to let Spring know how to
      actually convert the multipart objects the resolver has found to
      properties specified by the bean. In this example, nothing is done
      with the <literal>byte[]</literal> property of the bean itself, but
      in practice you can do whatever you want (save it in a database,
      mail it to somebody, etc).</para>

      <para>An equivalent example in which a file is bound straight to a
      String-typed property on a form backing object might look like
      this:</para>

      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public class FileUploadController extends SimpleFormController {

    public void onSubmitAction(ActionRequest request, ActionResponse response,
            Object command, BindException errors) throws Exception {

        FileUploadBean bean = (FileUploadBean) command;

        // let's see if there's content there
        String file = bean.getFile();
        if (file == null) {
            // hmm, that's strange, the user did not upload anything
        }

        // do something with the file here
    }

    protected void initBinder(
        PortletRequest request, PortletRequestDataBinder binder) throws Exception {

        // to actually be able to convert Multipart instance to a String
        // we have to register a custom editor
        binder.registerCustomEditor(String.class,
            new StringMultipartFileEditor());
        // now Spring knows how to handle multipart objects and convert
    }
}

public class FileUploadBean {

    private String file;

    public void setFile(String file) {
        this.file = file;
    }

    public String getFile() {
        return file;
    }
}]]></programlisting>

      <para>Of course, this last example only makes (logical) sense in the
      context of uploading a plain text file (it wouldn't work so well in
      the case of uploading an image file).</para>

      <para>The third (and final) option is where one binds directly to a
      <interfacename>MultipartFile</interfacename> property declared on
      the (form backing) object's class. In this case one does not need to
      register any custom property editor because there is no type
      conversion to be performed.</para>

      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public class FileUploadController extends SimpleFormController {

    <para>Just like Servlet MVC, Portlet MVC provides
    <interfacename>HandlerExceptionResolver</interfacename>s to ease the

    provides a portlet-specific, concrete

    support is available for both Servlet MVC and Portlet MVC. Controllers
    implemented in this style do not have to extend specific base classes or

      <title>Defining a controller with

      <para>The <interfacename>@Controller</interfacename> annotation indicates

      There is no need to extend any controller base class or reference the
      Portlet API. You are of course still able to reference Portlet-specific
      features if you need to.</para>

      <para>The basic purpose of the <interfacename>@Controller</interfacename>

      its role. The dispatcher will scan such annotated classes for mapped
      methods, detecting <interfacename>@RequestMapping</interfacename>
      annotations (see the next section).</para>

      <para>Annotated controller beans may be defined explicitly,
      using a standard Spring bean definition in the dispatcher's context.
      However, the <interfacename>@Controller</interfacename> stereotype also
      allows for autodetection, aligned with Spring 2.5's general support for
      detecting component classes in the classpath and auto-registering bean
      definitions for them.</para>

      <para>To enable autodetection of such annotated controllers, you have to add

      <title>Mapping requests with

      <para>The <interfacename>@RequestMapping</interfacename> annotation is used
      to map portlet modes like 'VIEW'/'EDIT' onto an entire class or a particular
      handler method. Typically the type-level annotation maps a specific mode
      (or mode plus parameter condition) onto a form controller, with additional
      method-level annotations 'narrowing' the primary mapping for specific
      portlet request parameters.</para>

      <tip>
        <para><interfacename>@RequestMapping</interfacename> at the type
        level may be used for plain implementations of the
        <interfacename>Controller</interfacename> interface as well.
        In this case, the request processing code would follow the
        traditional <literal>handle(Action|Render)Request</literal> signature,
        while the controller's mapping would be expressed through an
        <interfacename>@RequestMapping</interfacename> annotation.
        This works for pre-built <interfacename>Controller</interfacename>
        base classes, such as <classname>SimpleFormController</classname>,

      <title>Binding request parameters to method parameters with
      <classname>@RequestParam</classname></title>

      <para>The <classname>@RequestParam</classname> annotation is used to
      bind request parameters to a method parameter in your controller.</para>

      <para>The following code snippet from the PetPortal sample application
      shows the usage:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">@Controller
@RequestMapping("EDIT")
@SessionAttributes("site")
public class PetSitesEditController {

    <lineannotation>// ...</lineannotation>

    public void removeSite(<emphasis role="bold">@RequestParam("site")</emphasis> String site, ActionResponse response) {
        this.petSites.remove(site);
        response.setRenderParameter("action", "list");
    }

    <lineannotation>// ...</lineannotation>
}
</programlisting>

      <para>Parameters using this annotation are required by default, but you
      can specify that a parameter is optional by setting
      <interfacename>@RequestParam</interfacename>'s
      <literal>required</literal> attribute to <literal>false</literal> (e.g.,
      <literal>@RequestParam(value="id", required=false)</literal>).</para>
    </section>

    <section id="portlet-ann-modelattrib">
      <title>Providing a link to data from the model with
      <classname>@ModelAttribute</classname></title>

      <para><classname>@ModelAttribute</classname> has two usage scenarios in
      controllers. When placed on a method parameter,
      <classname>@ModelAttribute</classname> is used to map a model attribute
      to the specific, annotated method parameter (see the
      <literal>populateSite()</literal> method below). This is how the
      controller gets a reference to the object holding the data entered in
      the form. In addition, the parameter can be declared as the specific
      type of the form backing object rather than as a generic
      <classname>java.lang.Object</classname>, thus increasing type
      safety.</para>

      <para><classname>@ModelAttribute</classname> is also used at the method
      level to provide <emphasis>reference data</emphasis> for the model (see
      the <literal>getPetSites()</literal> method below). For this usage
      the method signature can contain the same types as documented above for
      the <classname>@RequestMapping</classname> annotation.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Note:</emphasis> <classname>@ModelAttribute</classname>
      annotated methods will be executed <emphasis>before</emphasis> the
      chosen <classname>@RequestMapping</classname> annotated handler method.
      They effectively pre-populate the implicit model with specific attributes,
      often loaded from a database. Such an attribute can then already be
      accessed through <classname>@ModelAttribute</classname> annotated
      handler method parameters in the chosen handler method, potentially
      with binding and validation applied to it.</para>

      <para>The following code snippet shows these two usages of this
      annotation:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">@Controller
@RequestMapping("EDIT")
@SessionAttributes("site")
public class PetSitesEditController {

    <lineannotation>// ...</lineannotation>

    <emphasis role="bold">@ModelAttribute("petSites")</emphasis>
    public Properties getPetSites() {
        return this.petSites;
    }

    @RequestMapping(params = "action=add")  // action phase
    public void populateSite(
            <emphasis role="bold">@ModelAttribute("site")</emphasis> PetSite petSite, BindingResult result,
            SessionStatus status, ActionResponse response) {

        new PetSiteValidator().validate(petSite, result);
        if (!result.hasErrors()) {
            this.petSites.put(petSite.getName(), petSite.getUrl());
            status.setComplete();
            response.setRenderParameter("action", "list");
        }
    }

    <section id="portlet-ann-sessionattrib">
      <title>Specifying attributes to store in a Session with
      <classname>@SessionAttributes</classname></title>

      <para>The type-level <classname>@SessionAttributes</classname>

      This will typically list the names of model attributes or types of
      model attributes which should be
      transparently stored in the session or some conversational storage,
      serving as form-backing beans between subsequent requests.</para>

      <para>The following code snippet shows the usage of this

      <para>To customize request parameter binding with PropertyEditors, etc.
      via Spring's <classname>WebDataBinder</classname>, you can either use
      <interfacename>@InitBinder</interfacename>-annotated methods within your

        <para>Annotating controller methods with
        <interfacename>@InitBinder</interfacename> allows you to configure web
        data binding directly within your controller class.
        <interfacename>@InitBinder</interfacename> identifies methods which
        initialize the <classname>WebDataBinder</classname> which will be used
        for populating command and form object arguments of annotated handler

        <para>Such init-binder methods support all arguments that
        <interfacename>@RequestMapping</interfacename> supports, except for
        command/form objects and corresponding validation result objects.
        Init-binder methods must not have a return value. Thus, they are
        usually declared as <literal>void</literal>. Typical arguments include
        <classname>WebDataBinder</classname> in combination with

    <title>Portlet application deployment</title>

    <para>The process of deploying a Spring Portlet MVC application is no
    different than deploying any JSR-168 Portlet application. However, this
    area is confusing enough in general that it is worth talking about here
    briefly.</para>

    <para>Generally, the portal/portlet container runs in one webapp in your
    servlet container and your portlets run in another webapp in your
    servlet container. In order for the portlet container webapp to make
    calls into your portlet webapp it must make cross-context calls to a
    well-known servlet that provides access to the portlet services defined
    in your <literal>portlet.xml</literal> file.</para>

    <para>The JSR-168 specification does not specify exactly how this should
    happen, so each portlet container has its own mechanism for this, which
    usually involves some kind of “deployment process” that makes changes to
    the portlet webapp itself and then registers the portlets within the
    portlet container.</para>

    <para>At a minimum, the <literal>web.xml</literal> file in your portlet
    webapp is modified to inject the well-known servlet that the portlet
    container will call. In some cases a single servlet will service all
    portlets in the webapp, in other cases there will be an instance of the
    servlet for each portlet.</para>

    <para>Some portlet containers will also inject libraries and/or
    configuration files into the webapp as well. The portlet container must
    also make its implementation of the Portlet JSP Tag Library available to
    your webapp.</para>

    <para>The bottom line is that it is important to understand the
    deployment needs of your target portal and make sure they are met
    (usually by following the automated deployment process it provides).
    Be sure to carefully review the documentation from your portal for this
    process.</para>

    <para>Once you have deployed your portlet, review the resulting
    <literal>web.xml</literal> file for sanity. Some older portals have
    been known to corrupt the definition of the
    <classname>ViewRendererServlet</classname>, thus breaking the rendering
    of your portlets.</para>
