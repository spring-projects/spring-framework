    <title>Advantages of the Spring Framework's transaction support model<!--Renamed section to make it more to the point. TR: OK--></title>

    <para>Traditionally, Java EE developers have had two choices for
    transaction management: <emphasis>global</emphasis> or
    <emphasis>local</emphasis> transactions, both of which have profound
    limitations. Global and local transaction management is reviewed in the
    next two sections, followed by a discussion of how the Spring Framework's
    transaction management support addresses the limitations of the global and
    local transaction models.</para>

    <!--Gave global, local, and spring models their own sections. These need to be called out at a higher level, esp. Spring advantage! TR: OK-->

    <section xml:id="transaction-global">
      <title>Global transactions</title>

      <para>Global transactions enable you to work with multiple transactional
      resources, typically relational databases and message queues. The
      application server manages global transactions through the JTA, which is
      a cumbersome API to use (partly due to its exception model).
      Furthermore, a JTA <interfacename>UserTransaction</interfacename>
      normally needs to be sourced from JNDI, meaning that you
      <emphasis>also</emphasis> need to use JNDI in order to use JTA.
      Obviously the use of global transactions would limit any potential reuse
      of application code, as JTA is normally only available in an application
      server environment.</para>

      <para>Previously, the preferred way to use global transactions was via
      EJB <emphasis>CMT</emphasis> (<emphasis>Container Managed
      Transaction</emphasis>): CMT is a form of <emphasis
      role="bold">declarative transaction management</emphasis> (as
      distinguished from <emphasis role="bold">programmatic transaction
      management</emphasis>). EJB CMT removes the need for transaction-related
      JNDI lookups, although of course the use of EJB itself necessitates the
      use of JNDI. It removes most but not all of the need to write Java code
      to control transactions. The significant downside is that CMT is tied to
      JTA and an application server environment. Also, it is only available if
      one chooses to implement business logic in EJBs, or at least behind a
      transactional EJB facade. The negatives of EJB in general are so great
      that this is not an attractive proposition, especially in the face of
      compelling alternatives for declarative transaction management.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="transaction-local">
      <title>Local transactions</title>

      <para>Local transactions are resource-specific, such as a transaction
      associated with a JDBC connection. Local transactions may be easier to
      use, but have significant disadvantages: they cannot work across
      multiple transactional resources. For example, code that manages
      transactions using a JDBC connection cannot run within a global JTA
      transaction. Because the application server is not involved in
      transaction management, it cannot help ensure correctness across
      multiple resources. (It is worth noting that most applications use a
      single transaction resource.) Another downside is that local
      transactions are invasive to the programming model.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="transaction-programming-model">
      <title>Spring Framework's consistent programming model</title>

      <para>Spring resolves the disadvantages of global and local
      transactions. It enables application developers to use a
      <emphasis>consistent</emphasis> programming model <emphasis>in any
      environment</emphasis>. You write your code once, and it can benefit
      from different transaction management strategies in different
      environments. The Spring Framework provides both declarative and
      programmatic transaction management. Most users prefer declarative
      transaction management, which is recommended in most cases.</para>

      <!--Do you need to specify that Spring allows you to work with *multiple* transactional resourcess (as global transactions do)? TR: OK AS IS-->

      <para>With programmatic transaction management, developers work with the
      Spring Framework transaction abstraction, which can run over any
      underlying transaction infrastructure. <!--Re preceding statement, does this mean that next section re transaction abstraction applies only to programmatic tx management?If so--><!--shouldn't the next section be subsection of *Programmatic transaction management* section? However, there is a sentence in the next--><!--section that reads *regardless of whether you opt for declarative or prog. tx man. defining correct PlatformTransactionManager impl. is--><!--absolutely essential.* This is followed by discussion of that impl. So I'm not sure what goes where.

TR: OK AS IS - I think it's fine as is - the concepts apply to both programmatic and declarative transactions
-->With the preferred declarative model, developers typically write little or
      no code related to transaction management, and hence do not depend on
      the Spring Framework transaction API, or any other transaction
      API.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Do you need an application server for transaction
        management?</title>

        <para>The Spring Framework's transaction management support changes
        traditional rules as to when an enterprise Java application requires
        an application server.</para>

        <para>In particular, you do not need an application server simply for
        declarative transactions through EJBs. In fact, even if your
        application server has powerful JTA capabilities, you may decide that
        the Spring Framework's declarative transactions offer more power and a
        more productive programming model than EJB CMT.</para>

        <para>Typically you need an application server's JTA capability only
        if your application needs to handle transactions across multiple
        resources, which is not a requirement for many applications. Many
        high-end applications use a single, highly scalable database (such as
        Oracle RAC) instead. Standalone transaction managers such as <link
        xl:href="http://www.atomikos.com/">Atomikos Transactions</link> and
        <link xl:href="http://jotm.objectweb.org/">JOTM</link> are other
        options. Of course, you may need other application server capabilities
        such as Java Message Service (JMS) and J2EE Connector Architecture
        (JCA).</para>

        <para>The Spring Framework <emphasis>gives you the choice of when to
        scale your application to a fully loaded application
        server</emphasis>. Gone are the days when the only alternative to
        using EJB CMT or JTA was to write code with local transactions such as
        those on JDBC connections, and face a hefty rework if you need that
        code to run within global, container-managed transactions. With the
        Spring Framework, only some of the bean definitions in your
        configuration file, rather than your code, need to change.</para>

        <!--CLarify last sentence. Only what kind of configuration has to change?
TR: REVISED, PLS REVIEW - changed to say "some of the bean definitions in your configuration file"-->
      </sidebar>

  <section xml:id="transaction-strategies">
    <title>Understanding the Spring Framework transaction abstraction<!--If this section applies only to prog. tx management, we should say that up front. Add info?
TR: OK AS IS - It's relevant for declarative tx as well--></title>

    <para>The key to the Spring transaction abstraction is the notion of a
    <emphasis>transaction strategy</emphasis>. A transaction strategy is
    defined by the
    <interfacename>org.springframework.transaction.PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename>
    interface:</para>

    <programlisting language="java">public interface PlatformTransactionManager {

  TransactionStatus getTransaction(TransactionDefinition definition)
    throws TransactionException;

  void commit(TransactionStatus status) throws TransactionException;

  void rollback(TransactionStatus status) throws TransactionException;
}</programlisting>

    <para>This is primarily a service provider interface (SPI), although it
    can be used <link
    linkend="transaction-programmatic-ptm">programmatically</link> from your
    application code. <!--Write out SPI with SPI in parentheses. SPI stands for a number of different things.And does logic of sentence make sense?
TR: REVISED, PLS REVIEW - spelled SPI out and added a bit of clarification at the end-->Because
    <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename> is an
    <emphasis>interface</emphasis>, it can be easily mocked or stubbed as
    necessary. It is not tied to a lookup strategy such as JNDI.
    <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename> implementations
    are defined like any other object (or bean) in the Spring Framework IoC
    container. This benefit alone makes Spring Framework transactions a
    worthwhile abstraction even when you work with JTA. Transactional code can
    be tested much more easily than if it used JTA directly.</para>

    <para>Again in keeping with Spring's philosophy, the
    <exceptionname>TransactionException</exceptionname> that can be thrown by
    any of the <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename>
    interface's methods is <emphasis>unchecked</emphasis> (that is, it extends
    the <exceptionname>java.lang.RuntimeException</exceptionname> class).
    Transaction infrastructure failures are almost invariably fatal. In rare
    cases where application code can actually recover from a transaction
    failure, the application developer can still choose to catch and handle
    <exceptionname>TransactionException</exceptionname>. The salient point is
    that developers are not <emphasis>forced</emphasis> to do so.</para>

    <para>The <methodname>getTransaction(..)</methodname> method returns a
    <interfacename>TransactionStatus</interfacename> object, depending on a
    <interfacename>TransactionDefinition</interfacename> parameter. The
    returned <interfacename>TransactionStatus</interfacename> might represent
    a new transaction, or can represent an existing transaction if a matching
    transaction exists in the current call stack. The implication in this
    latter case is that, as with Java EE transaction contexts, a
    <interfacename>TransactionStatus</interfacename> is associated with a
    <emphasis role="bold">thread</emphasis> of execution.<!--Previous sentences were difficult to follow because of all the parenthetical phrases.Revise if necessary. TR: OK AS IS--></para>

    <para>The <interfacename>TransactionDefinition</interfacename> interface
    specifies:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Isolation</emphasis>: The degree to which
        this transaction is isolated from the work of other transactions. For
        example, can this transaction see uncommitted writes from other
        transactions?</para>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Propagation</emphasis>: Typically, all
        code executed within a transaction scope will run in that transaction.
        However, you have the option of specifying the behavior in the event

        already exists. <!--Correct to say you have options? A human has to specify what the behavior will be, right? TR: REVISED, PLS REVIEW-->For
        example, code can continue running in the existing transaction (the

    <para>These settings reflect standard transactional concepts. If
    necessary, refer to resources that discuss transaction isolation levels
    and other core transaction concepts. Understanding these concepts is
    essential to using the Spring Framework or any transaction management
    solution.</para>

    <para>The <interfacename>TransactionStatus</interfacename> interface
    provides a simple way for transactional code to control transaction
    execution and query transaction status. The concepts should be familiar,
    as they are common to all transaction APIs:</para>

    <programlisting language="java">public interface TransactionStatus extends SavepointManager {

    boolean isNewTransaction();

    boolean hasSavepoint();

    void setRollbackOnly();

    boolean isRollbackOnly();

    void flush();

    boolean isCompleted();

}</programlisting>

    <para>Regardless of whether you opt for declarative or programmatic
    transaction management in Spring, defining the correct
    <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename> implementation
    is absolutely essential. You typically define this implementation through
    dependency injection.</para>

    <!--Do you need a link to an explanation of DI?
    TR: OK AS IS - at this point in the text, I don't think you would need that
    -->

    <para><interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename>
    implementations normally require knowledge of the environment in which
    they work: JDBC, JTA, Hibernate, and so on. The following examples show
    how you can define a local
    <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename> implementation.
    (This example works with plain JDBC.)</para>

    <para>You define a JDBC <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename></para>

    <programlisting language="xml">&lt;bean id="dataSource" class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource" destroy-method="close"&gt;
  &lt;property name="driverClassName" value="${jdbc.driverClassName}" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="url" value="${jdbc.url}" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="username" value="${jdbc.username}" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="password" value="${jdbc.password}" /&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>The related <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename>
    bean definition will then have a reference to the
    <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename> definition. It will look like this:</para>

    <programlisting language="xml">&lt;bean id="txManager" class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceTransactionManager"&gt;
  &lt;property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>If you use JTA in a Java EE container then you use a container
    <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename>, obtained through JNDI, in
    conjunction with Spring's <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname>.
    This is what the JTA and JNDI lookup version would look like:</para>

    <!--Indicate what the following example demonstrates.What is its purpose? TR: REVISED, PLS REVIEW-->

&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>The <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname> does not need to
    know about the <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename>, or any other
    specific resources, because it uses the container's global transaction
    management infrastructure.</para>

    <note>
      <para>The above definition of the <literal>dataSource</literal> bean
      uses the <literal>&lt;jndi-lookup/&gt;</literal> tag from the
      <literal>jee</literal> namespace. For more information on schema-based
      configuration, see <xref linkend="xsd-config" />, and for more

      entitled <xref linkend="xsd-config-body-schemas-jee" />.</para>
    </note>

    <para>You can also use Hibernate local transactions easily, as shown in
    the following examples. In this case, you need to define a Hibernate
    <classname>LocalSessionFactoryBean</classname>, which your application
    code will use to obtain Hibernate <interfacename>Session</interfacename>
    instances.</para>

    <para>The <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename> bean definition will
    be similar to the local JDBC example shown previously and thus is not
    shown in the following example.</para>

    <!-- TR: added the following clarification rather than embed it in the text above-->

    <note>
      <para>If the <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename>, used by any
      non-JTA transaction manager, is looked up via JNDI and managed by a Java
      EE container, then it should be non-transactional because the Spring
      Framework, rather than the Java EE container, will manage the
      transactions.</para>
    </note>

    <para>The <literal>txManager</literal> bean in this case is of the
    <classname>HibernateTransactionManager</classname> type. In the same way
    as the <classname>DataSourceTransactionManager</classname> needs a
    reference to the <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename>, the
    <classname>HibernateTransactionManager</classname> needs a reference to
    the <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename>.</para>

  &lt;property name="sessionFactory" ref="sessionFactory" /&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>If you are using Hibernate and Java EE container-managed JTA
    transactions, then you should simply use the same
    <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname> as in the previous JTA
    example for JDBC.<!--Use it to do what? Below, this *what* is identical to JTA config

    <programlisting language="xml">&lt;bean id="txManager" class="org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager"/&gt;</programlisting>

    <note>
      <para>If you use JTA , then your transaction manager definition will
      look the same regardless of what data access technology you use, be it
      JDBC, Hibernate JPA or any other supported technology. This is due to
      the fact that JTA transactions are global transactions, which can enlist
      any transactional resource.</para>
    </note>

    <para>In all these cases, application code does not need to change. You
    can change how transactions are managed merely by changing configuration,
    even if that change means moving from local to global transactions or vice
    versa.</para>

  <section xml:id="tx-resource-synchronization">
    <title>Synchronizing resources with transactions</title>

    <para>It should now be clear how you create different transaction
    managers, and how they are linked to related resources that need to be
    synchronized to transactions (for example
    <classname>DataSourceTransactionManager</classname> to a JDBC
    <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename>,
    <classname>HibernateTransactionManager</classname> to a Hibernate
    <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename>, and so forth). This section
    describes how the application code, directly or indirectly using a
    persistence API such as JDBC, Hibernate, or JDO, ensures that these
    resources are created, reused, and cleaned up properly. The section also
    discusses how transaction synchronization is triggered (optionally)
    through the relevant
    <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename>.<!--I broke into two sentences. Last part of sentence unclear,revise to say what triggers tx synch. Revise sentences if necessray. TR: OK--></para>

      <title>High-level synchronization approach</title>

      <para>The preferred approach is to use Spring's highest level template

      transaction- aware factory beans or proxies for managing the native
      resource factories. These transaction-aware solutions internally handle
      resource creation and reuse, cleanup, optional transaction
      synchronization of the resources, and exception mapping. Thus user data
      access code does not have to address these tasks, but can be focused
      purely on non-boilerplate persistence logic. Generally, you use the
      native ORM API or take a <emphasis>template</emphasis> approach for JDBC
      access by using the <classname>JdbcTemplate</classname>. These solutions
      are detailed in subsequent chapters of this reference documentation.<!--If this approach is preferred, why not give examples here as you do with less desirable approaches?

      are obtained, transactions are (optionally) synchronized, and exceptions
      that occur in the process are properly mapped to a consistent
      API.</para>

      <para>For example, in the case of JDBC, instead of the traditional JDBC
      approach of calling the <literal>getConnection()</literal> method on the
      <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename>, you instead use Spring's
      <classname>org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceUtils</classname>
      class as follows:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">Connection conn = DataSourceUtils.getConnection(dataSource);</programlisting>

      <para>If an existing transaction already has a connection synchronized
      (linked) to it, that instance is returned. Otherwise, the method call
      triggers the creation of a new connection, which is (optionally)
      synchronized to any existing transaction, and made available for
      subsequent reuse in that same transaction. As mentioned, any
      <exceptionname>SQLException</exceptionname> is wrapped in a Spring
      Framework
      <exceptionname>CannotGetJdbcConnectionException</exceptionname>, one of
      the Spring Framework's hierarchy of unchecked DataAccessExceptions. This
      approach gives you more information than can be obtained easily from the
      <exceptionname>SQLException</exceptionname>, and ensures portability
      across databases, even across different persistence technologies.</para>

      <para>This approach also works without Spring transaction management
      (transaction synchronization is optional), so you can use it whether or
      not you are using Spring for transaction management.</para>

      <para>Of course, once you have used Spring's JDBC support, JPA support
      or Hibernate support, you will generally prefer not to use
      <classname>DataSourceUtils</classname> or the other helper classes,
      because you will be much happier working through the Spring abstraction
      than directly with the relevant APIs. For example, if you use the Spring
      <classname>JdbcTemplate</classname> or <literal>jdbc.object</literal>
      package to simplify your use of JDBC, correct connection retrieval
      occurs behind the scenes and you won't need to write any special
      code.</para>

      <!--I don't understand this. Why tell them to use DataSourceUtils and then say you will prefer Spring abstraction?
Why not give example of using Spring abstraction?

      <para>At the very lowest level exists the

      proxy for a target <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename>, which
      wraps the target <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename> to add
      awareness of Spring-managed transactions. In this respect, it is similar

    <title>Declarative transaction management</title>

    <note>
      <para>Most Spring Framework users choose declarative transaction
      management. This option has the least impact on application code, and
      hence is most consistent with the ideals of a
      <emphasis>non-invasive</emphasis> lightweight container.</para>
    </note>

    <para>The Spring Framework's declarative transaction management is made
    possible with Spring aspect-oriented programming (AOP), although, as the
    transactional aspects code comes with the Spring Framework distribution
    and may be used in a boilerplate fashion, AOP concepts do not generally
    have to be understood to make effective use of this code.</para>

    <para>The Spring Framework's declarative transaction management is similar
    to EJB CMT in that you can specify transaction behavior (or lack of it)
    down to individual method level. It is possible to make a
    <methodname>setRollbackOnly()</methodname> call within a transaction
    context if necessary. The differences between the two types of transaction
    management are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Unlike EJB CMT, which is tied to JTA, the Spring Framework's
        declarative transaction management works in any environment. It can
        work with JTA transactions or local transactions using JDBC, JPA,
        Hibernate or JDO by simply adjusting the configuration files.<!--Indicate what kind of config changes? Changes to what

      <listitem>
        <para>You can apply the Spring Framework declarative transaction

        EJBs.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>The Spring Framework offers declarative <link

      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The Spring Framework enables you to customize transactional
        behavior, by using AOP. For example, you can insert custom behavior in

        the container's transaction management except with
        <methodname>setRollbackOnly()</methodname>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The Spring Framework does not support propagation of transaction

        you need this feature, we recommend that you use EJB. However,

        does not want transactions to span remote calls.</para>

      <title>Where is
      <classname>TransactionProxyFactoryBean</classname>?</title>

      <para>Declarative transaction configuration in versions of Spring 2.0
      and above differs considerably from previous versions of Spring. The
      main difference is that there is no longer any need to configure
      <classname>TransactionProxyFactoryBean</classname> beans.</para>

      <para>The pre-Spring 2.0 configuration style is still 100% valid
      configuration; think of the new <literal>&lt;tx:tags/&gt;</literal> as
      simply defining <classname>TransactionProxyFactoryBean</classname> beans
      on your behalf.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>The concept of rollback rules is important: they enable you to
    specify which exceptions (and throwables) <!--If no difference between exceptions and throwables, delete throwables. TR: OK AS IS-->should
    cause automatic rollback. You specify this declaratively, in
    configuration, not in Java code. So, although you can still call
    <methodname>setRollbackOnly()</methodname>on the
    <interfacename>TransactionStatus</interfacename> object to roll back the
    current transaction back, most often you can specify a rule that
    <exceptionname>MyApplicationException</exceptionname> must always result
    in rollback. The significant advantage to this option is that business
    objects do not depend on the transaction infrastructure. For example, they
    typically do not need to import Spring transaction APIs or other Spring
    APIs.</para>

    <para>Although EJB container default behavior automatically rolls back the
    transaction on a <emphasis>system exception</emphasis> (usually a runtime
    exception), EJB CMT does not roll back the transaction automatically on an
    <emphasis>application exception</emphasis> (that is, a checked exception
    other than <exceptionname>java.rmi.RemoteException</exceptionname>). While
    the Spring default behavior for declarative transaction management follows
    EJB convention (roll back is automatic only on unchecked exceptions), it
    is often useful to customize this behavior.</para>

    <!--customize this so that what happens? TR: OK AS IS - i think - the option is to provide alternate rules for when a transaction
would be rolled back, not necessarily following the EJB rules-->

      <para>A common requirement is to make an entire service layer

      <title>Rolling back a declarative transaction</title>

      <para>The previous section outlined the basics of how to specify
      transactional settings for classes, typically service layer classes,
      declaratively in your application. This section describes how you can
      control the rollback of transactions in a simple declarative
      fashion.</para>

      <para>The recommended way to indicate to the Spring Framework's
      transaction infrastructure that a transaction's work is to be rolled
      back is to throw an <exceptionname>Exception</exceptionname> from code
      that is currently executing in the context of a transaction. The Spring
      Framework's transaction infrastructure code will catch any unhandled
      <exceptionname>Exception</exceptionname> as it bubbles up the call
      stack, and make a determination whether to mark the transaction for
      rollback.<!--I changed to *can be configured* because next sentence says it does not do this by default in all cases.
TR: REVISED, PLS REVIEW. I changed it to *in its default configuration*BT: I STILL DON'T GET IT. PRECEDING SENTENCE AND FOLLOWING --><!--SENTENCE SEEM CONTRADICTORY. TR: REVISED AGAIN, PLS REVIEW.--></para>

      <para>In its default configuration, the Spring Framework's transaction
      infrastructure code <emphasis>only</emphasis> marks a transaction for
      rollback in the case of runtime, unchecked exceptions; that is, when the
      thrown exception is an instance or subclass of
      <exceptionname>RuntimeException</exceptionname>.
      (<exceptionname>Error</exceptionname>s will also - by default - result
      in a rollback). Checked exceptions that are thrown from a transactional
      method do <emphasis>not</emphasis> result in rollback in the default
      configuration.<!--I revised preceding because it says ONLY first case is rolled back by default, but then says Errors are also marked by default.
TR: OK AS IS. Errors aren't thrown by application code, only checked or unchecked exceptions are. So the Errors part is just clarifying that
if the underlying application server infrastructure throws an Error the transaction will be rolled back.--></para>

      <para>You can configure exactly which
      <exceptionname>Exception</exceptionname> types mark a transaction for
      rollback, including checked exceptions. The following XML snippet
      demonstrates how you configure rollback for a checked,
      application-specific <exceptionname>Exception</exceptionname>
      type.</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;tx:advice id="txAdvice" transaction-manager="txManager"&gt;

  &lt;tx:method name="*"/&gt;
  &lt;/tx:attributes&gt;
&lt;/tx:advice&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>You can also specify 'no rollback rules', if you do
      <emphasis>not</emphasis> want a transaction rolled back when an
      exception is thrown. The following example tells the Spring Framework's
      transaction infrastructure to commit the attendant transaction even in

      <para>When the Spring Framework's transaction infrastructure catches an
      exception and is consults configured rollback rules to determine whether
      to mark the transaction for rollback, the <emphasis>strongest</emphasis>
      matching rule wins. So in the case of the following configuration, any
      exception other than an
      <exceptionname>InstrumentNotFoundException</exceptionname> results in a
      rollback of the attendant transaction.</para>

&lt;/tx:advice&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>You can also indicate a required rollback
      <emphasis>programmatically</emphasis>. Although very simple, this
      process is quite invasive, and tightly couples your code to the Spring
      Framework's transaction infrastructure:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">public void resolvePosition() {
  try {
    <lineannotation>// some business logic...</lineannotation>
  } catch (NoProductInStockException ex) {
    <lineannotation>// trigger rollback programmatically</lineannotation>
    TransactionAspectSupport.currentTransactionStatus().setRollbackOnly();
  }
}</programlisting>

      <para>You are strongly encouraged to use the declarative approach to
      rollback if at all possible. Programmatic rollback is available should
      you absolutely need it, but its usage flies in the face of achieving a
      clean POJO-based architecture.</para>

      <title>Using <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename></title>

      <para>In addition to the XML-based declarative approach to transaction
      configuration, you can use an annotation-based approach. Declaring
      transaction semantics directly in the Java source code puts the
      declarations much closer to the affected code. There is not much danger
      of undue coupling, because code that is meant to be used transactionally
      is almost always deployed that way anyway.</para>

      <para>The ease-of-use afforded by the use of the
      <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename> annotation is best
      illustrated with an example, which is explained in the text that
      follows. Consider the following class definition:</para>

      <programlisting language="java"><lineannotation>// the service class that we want to make transactional</lineannotation>
<emphasis role="bold">@Transactional</emphasis>
public class DefaultFooService implements FooService {

  Foo getFoo(String fooName);

  Foo getFoo(String fooName, String barName);

  void insertFoo(Foo foo);

  void updateFoo(Foo foo);
}</programlisting>

      <para>When the above POJO is defined as a bean in a Spring IoC
      container, the bean instance can be made transactional by adding merely
      <emphasis>one</emphasis> line of XML configuration:</para>

      <tip>
        <para>You can omit the <literal>transaction-manager</literal>
        attribute in the <literal>&lt;tx:annotation-driven/&gt;</literal> tag
        if the bean name of the
        <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename> that you
        want to wire in has the name <literal>transactionManager</literal>. If
        the <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename> bean
        that you want to dependency-inject has any other name, then you have
        to use the <literal>transaction-manager</literal> attribute
        explicitly, as in the preceding example.</para>
      </tip>

      <note>
        <para>The <interfacename>@EnableTransactionManagement</interfacename>
        annotation provides equivalent support if you are using Java based
        configuration. Simply add the annotation to a
        <interfacename>@Configuration</interfacename> class. See Javadoc
        for full details.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Method visibility and
        <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename></title>

        <para>When using proxies, you should apply the
        <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename> annotation only to
        methods with <emphasis>public</emphasis> visibility. If you do
        annotate protected, private or package-visible methods with the
        <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename> annotation, no error is
        raised, but the annotated method does not exhibit the configured
        transactional settings. Consider the use of AspectJ (see below) if you
        need to annotate non-public methods.</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>You can place the <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename>
      annotation before an interface definition, a method on an interface, a
      class definition, or a <emphasis>public</emphasis> method on a class.
      However, the mere presence of the
      <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename> annotation is not enough
      to activate the transactional behavior. The
      <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename> annotation is simply
      metadata that can be consumed by some runtime infrastructure that is
      <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename>-aware and that can use the
      metadata to configure the appropriate beans with transactional behavior.
      In the preceding example, the
      <literal>&lt;tx:annotation-driven/&gt;</literal> element
      <emphasis>switches on</emphasis> the transactional behavior.</para>

      <para><tip>
          <para>Spring recommends that you only annotate concrete classes (and
          methods of concrete classes) with the
          <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename> annotation, as opposed
          to annotating interfaces. You certainly can place the
          <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename> annotation on an
          interface (or an interface method), but this works only as you would
          expect it to if you are using interface-based proxies. The fact that
          Java annotations are <emphasis>not inherited from interfaces</emphasis>
          means that if you are using class-based proxies
          (<literal>proxy-target-class="true"</literal>) or the weaving-based
          aspect (<literal>mode="aspectj"</literal>), then the transaction
          settings are not recognized by the proxying and weaving
          infrastructure, and the object will not be wrapped in a
          transactional proxy, which would be decidedly
          <emphasis>bad</emphasis>.</para>
        </tip></para>

      <note>
        <para>In proxy mode (which is the default), only external method calls
        coming in through the proxy are intercepted. This means that
        self-invocation, in effect, a method within the target object calling
        another method of the target object, will not lead to an actual
        transaction at runtime even if the invoked method is marked with
        <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename>.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Consider the use of AspectJ mode (see mode attribute in table
      below) if you expect self-invocations to be wrapped with transactions as
      well. <!--*see below* is not clear re AspectJmode. Provide clear x-ref to mode in table below, or to Using Transactional with AspectJ section. Also clarify reference to *as well*. As well as what?--><!--Below, *in this case* meaning in *what* case? Explain what table shows. TR: REVISED, PLS REVIEW-->In
      this case, there will not be a proxy in the first place; instead, the
      target class will be weaved (that is, its byte code will be modified) in
      order to turn <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename> into runtime
      behavior on any kind of method.</para>

      <section xml:id="tx-multiple-tx-mgrs-with-attransactional">
        <title>Multiple Transaction Managers with <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename></title>
        <para>
          Most Spring applications only need a single transaction manager, but there may be situations
          where you want multiple independent transaction managers in a single application.
          The value attribute of the <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename> annotation can
          be used to optionally specify the identity of the <classname>PlatformTransactionManager</classname>
          to be used. This can either be the bean name or the qualifier value of the transaction manager bean.
          For example, using the qualifier notation, the following Java code
<programlisting language="java">
  public class TransactionalService {

    @Transactional("order")
    public void setSomething(String name) { ... }

    @Transactional("account")
    public void doSomething() { ... }
  }
</programlisting>
          could be combined with the following transaction manager bean declarations in the application context.
<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[
  <tx:annotation-driven/>

  <bean id="transactionManager1" class="org.springframework.jdbc.DataSourceTransactionManager">
    ...
    <qualifier value="order"/>
  </bean>

  <bean id="transactionManager2" class="org.springframework.jdbc.DataSourceTransactionManager">
    ...
    <qualifier value="account"/>
  </bean>
]]>
</programlisting>
          In this case, the two methods on <literal>TransactionalService</literal> will run under separate
          transaction managers, differentiated by the "order" and "account" qualifiers.
          The default <literal>&lt;tx:annotation-driven&gt;</literal> target bean name <literal>transactionManager</literal> will
          still be used if no specifically qualified PlatformTransactionManager bean is found.

        <title>Custom shortcut annotations</title>
        <para>
          If you find you are repeatedly using the same attributes with <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename>
          on many different methods, then Spring's meta-annotation support allows you to define custom shortcut
          annotations for your specific use cases. For example, defining the following annotations
<programlisting language="java">
  @Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.TYPE})
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  @Transactional("order")
  public @interface OrderTx {
  }

  @Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.TYPE})
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  @Transactional("account")
  public @interface AccountTx {
  }
</programlisting>
          allows us to write the example from the previous section as
<programlisting language="java">
  public class TransactionalService {

    @OrderTx
    public void setSomething(String name) { ... }

    @AccountTx
    public void doSomething() { ... }
  }
</programlisting>
          Here we have used the syntax to define the transaction manager qualifier, but could also have
          included propagation behavior, rollback rules, timeouts etc.

        <para>When the propagation setting is
        <literal>PROPAGATION_REQUIRED</literal>, a
        <emphasis>logical</emphasis> transaction scope is created for each
        method upon which the setting is applied. Each such logical
        transaction scope can determine rollback-only status individually,
        with an outer transaction scope being logically independent from the
        inner transaction scope. Of course, in case of standard
        <literal>PROPAGATION_REQUIRED</literal> behavior, all these scopes<!--OK? Need to identify *they*. TR: OK AS IS-->
        will be mapped to the same physical transaction. So a rollback-only
        marker set in the inner transaction scope does affect the outer
        transaction's chance to actually commit (as you would expect it
        to).<!--Do you need to explain what an inner transaction scope as opposed to an outer transaction scope? TR: OK AS IS--></para>

        <para>However, in the case where an inner transaction scope sets the
        rollback-only marker, the outer transaction has not decided on the
        rollback itself, and so the rollback (silently triggered by the inner
        transaction scope) is unexpected. A corresponding
        <classname>UnexpectedRollbackException</classname> is thrown at that
        point. This is <emphasis>expected behavior</emphasis> so that the
        caller of a transaction can never be misled to assume that a commit
        was performed when it really was not. So if an inner transaction (of
        which the outer caller is not aware) silently marks a transaction as
        rollback-only, the outer caller still calls commit. The outer caller
        needs to receive an <classname>UnexpectedRollbackException</classname>
        to indicate clearly that a rollback was performed instead.</para>

      <para>It is also possible to use the Spring Framework's

      Spring container by means of an AspectJ aspect. To do so, you first
      annotate your classes (and optionally your classes' methods) with the

      link (weave) your application with the
      <classname>org.springframework.transaction.aspectj.AnnotationTransactionAspect</classname>
      defined in the <filename
      class="libraryfile">spring-aspects.jar</filename> file. The aspect must
      also be configured with a transaction manager. You can of course use the
      Spring Framework's IoC container to take care of dependency-injecting
      the aspect. The simplest way to configure the transaction management
      aspect is to use the <literal>&lt;tx:annotation-driven/&gt;</literal>

    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The Spring team generally recommends the
    <classname>TransactionTemplate</classname> for programmatic transaction
    management. The second approach is similar to using the JTA
    <interfacename>UserTransaction</interfacename> API, although exception
    handling is less cumbersome.</para>

    <section xml:id="tx-prog-template">
      <title>Using the <classname>TransactionTemplate</classname></title>

      <para>The <classname>TransactionTemplate</classname> adopts the same
      approach as other Spring <emphasis>templates</emphasis> such as the
      <classname>JdbcTemplate</classname>. It uses a callback approach, to
      free application code from having to do the boilerplate acquisition and
      release of transactional resources, and results in code that is
      intention driven, in that the code that is written focuses solely on
      what the developer wants to do.</para>

      <note>
        <para>As you will see in the examples that follow, using the

      <para>Application code that must execute in a transactional context, and

      <interfacename>TransactionCallback</interfacename> implementation
      (typically expressed as an anonymous inner class) that contains the code
      that you need to execute in the context of a transaction. You then pass
      an instance of your custom
      <interfacename>TransactionCallback</interfacename> to the
      <methodname>execute(..)</methodname> method exposed on the
      <classname>TransactionTemplate</classname>.</para>

    <title>Choosing between programmatic and declarative transaction
    management</title>

    <para>Programmatic transaction management is usually a good idea only if
    you have a small number of transactional operations. For example, if you
    have a web application that require transactions only for certain update
    operations, you may not want to set up transactional proxies using Spring
    or any other technology. In this case, using the
    <classname>TransactionTemplate</classname> <emphasis>may</emphasis> be a
    good approach. Being able to set the transaction name explicitly is also
    something that can only be done using the programmatic approach to
    transaction management.</para>

    <para>On the other hand, if your application has numerous transactional
    operations, declarative transaction management is usually worthwhile. It
    keeps transaction management out of business logic, and is not difficult
    to configure. When using the Spring Framework, rather than EJB CMT, the
    configuration cost of declarative transaction management is greatly
    reduced.</para>

  <section xml:id="transaction-application-server-integration">
    <title>Application server-specific integration</title>

    <para>Spring's transaction abstraction generally is application server
    agnostic. Additionally, Spring's
    <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname> class, which can optionally
    perform a JNDI lookup for the JTA
    <interfacename>UserTransaction</interfacename> and
    <interfacename>TransactionManager</interfacename> objects, autodetects the
    location for the latter object, which varies by application server. Having
    access to the JTA <interfacename>TransactionManager</interfacename> allows
    for enhanced transaction semantics, in particular supporting transaction
    suspension. See the <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname> Javadocs
    for details.</para>

    <para>Spring's <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname> is the
    standard choice to run on Java EE application servers, and is known to
    work on all common servers. Advanced functionality such as transaction
    suspension works on many servers as well -- including GlassFish, JBoss
    and Geronimo -- without any special configuration required.
    However, for fully supported transaction suspension and further advanced
    integration, Spring ships special adapters for WebLogic Server and
    WebSphere. These adapters are discussed in the following sections.</para>

    <para><emphasis>For standard scenarios, including WebLogic Server and
    WebSphere, consider using the convenient
    <literal>&lt;tx:jta-transaction-manager/&gt;</literal> configuration
    element.</emphasis> When configured, this element automatically detects
    the underlying server and chooses the best transaction manager available
    for the platform. This means that you won't have to configure
    server-specific adapter classes (as discussed in the following sections)
    explicitly; rather, they are chosen automatically, with the standard
    <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname> as default fallback.</para>

    <section xml:id="transaction-application-server-integration-websphere">
      <title>IBM WebSphere</title>

      <para>On WebSphere 6.1.0.9 and above, the recommended Spring JTA
      transaction manager to use is
      <classname>WebSphereUowTransactionManager</classname>. This special
      adapter leverages IBM's <interfacename>UOWManager</interfacename> API,
      which is available in WebSphere Application Server 6.0.2.19 and later
      and 6.1.0.9 and later. With this adapter, Spring-driven transaction
