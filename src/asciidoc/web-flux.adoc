= WebFlux framework

This section provides basic information on the reactive programming
support for Web applications in Spring Framework 5.


[[web-reactive-intro]]
== Introduction


[[web-reactive-programming]]
=== What is Reactive Programming?

In plain terms reactive programming is about non-blocking applications that are asynchronous
and event-driven and require a small number of threads to scale vertically (i.e. within the
JVM) rather than horizontally (i.e. through clustering).

A key aspect of reactive applications is the concept of backpressure which is
a mechanism to ensure producers don't overwhelm consumers. For example in a pipeline
of reactive components extending from the database to the HTTP response when the
HTTP connection is too slow the data repository can also slow down or stop completely
until network capacity frees up.

Reactive programming also leads to a major shift from imperative to declarative async
composition of logic. It is comparable to writing blocking code vs using the
`CompletableFuture` from Java 8 to compose follow-up actions via lambda expressions.

[[web-reactive-api]]
=== Reactive API and Building Blocks

Spring Framework 5 embraces
https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm#reactive-streams[Reactive Streams]
as the contract for communicating backpressure across async components and
libraries. Reactive Streams is a specification created through industry collaboration that
has also been adopted in Java 9 as `java.util.concurrent.Flow`.

The Spring Framework uses https://projectreactor.io/[Reactor] internally for its own
reactive support. Reactor is a Reactive Streams implementation that further extends the
basic Reactive Streams `Publisher` contract with the `Flux` and `Mono` composable API
types to provide declarative operations on data sequences of `0..N` and `0..1`.

The Spring Framework exposes `Flux` and `Mono` in many of its own reactive APIs.
At the application level however, as always, Spring provides choice and fully supports
the use of RxJava. For more on reactive types check the post
https://spring.io/blog/2016/04/19/understanding-reactive-types["Understanding Reactive Types"]
by Sebastien Deleuze.


[[web-reactive-feature-overview]]
== Spring WebFlux Module

Spring Framework 5 includes a new `spring-webflux` module. The module contains support
for reactive HTTP and WebSocket clients as well as for reactive server web applications
including REST, HTML browser, and WebSocket style interactions.

[[web-reactive-server]]
=== Server Side

On the server-side WebFlux supports 2 distinct programming models:

* Annotation-based with `@Controller` and the other annotations supported also with Spring MVC
* Functional, Java 8 lambda style routing and handling

Both programming models are executed on the same reactive foundation that adapts
non-blocking HTTP runtimes to the Reactive Streams API. The diagram
below shows the server-side stack including traditional, Servlet-based
Spring MVC on the left from the `spring-webmvc` module and also the
reactive stack on the right from the `spring-webflux` module.

image::images/webflux-overview.png[width=720]

WebFlux can run on Servlet containers with support for the
Servlet 3.1 Non-Blocking IO API as well as on other async runtimes such as
Netty and Undertow. Each runtime is adapted to a reactive
`ServerHttpRequest` and `ServerHttpResponse` exposing the body of the
request and response as `Flux<DataBuffer>`, rather than
`InputStream` and `OutputStream`, with reactive backpressure.
REST-style JSON and XML serialization and deserialization is supported on top
as a `Flux<Object>`, and so is HTML view rendering and Server-Sent Events.

[[web-reactive-server-annotation]]
==== Annotation-based Programming Model

The same `@Controller` programming model and the same annotations used in Spring MVC
are also supported in WebFlux. The main difference is that the underlying core,
framework contracts -- i.e. `HandlerMapping`, `HandlerAdapter`, are
non-blocking and operate on the reactive `ServerHttpRequest` and `ServerHttpResponse`
rather than on the `HttpServletRequest` and `HttpServletResponse`.
Below is an example with a reactive controller:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@RestController
public class PersonController {

	private final PersonRepository repository;

	public PersonController(PersonRepository repository) {
		this.repository = repository;
	}

	@PostMapping("/person")
	Mono<Void> create(@RequestBody Publisher<Person> personStream) {
		return this.repository.save(personStream).then();
	}

	@GetMapping("/person")
	Flux<Person> list() {
		return this.repository.findAll();
	}

	@GetMapping("/person/{id}")
	Mono<Person> findById(@PathVariable String id) {
		return this.repository.findOne(id);
	}
}
----

[[web-reactive-server-functional]]
==== Functional Programming Model

The functional programming model uses Java 8 lambda style routing and request
handling instead of annotations. The main API contracts are functional interfaces named
`RouterFunction` and `HandlerFunction`. They are simple but powerful building blocks
for creating web applications. Below is an example of functional request handling:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
PersonRepository repository = ...

RouterFunctions
	.route(GET("/person/{id}").and(accept(APPLICATION_JSON)), request -> {
		int personId = Integer.valueOf(request.pathVariable("id"));
		Mono<ServerResponse> notFound = ServerResponse.notFound().build();
		return repository.findOne(personId)
				.then(person -> ServerResponse.ok().body(Mono.just(person), Person.class))
				.otherwiseIfEmpty(notFound);
	})
	.andRoute(GET("/person").and(accept(APPLICATION_JSON)), request ->
			ServerResponse.ok().body(repository.findAll(), Person.class))
	.andRoute(POST("/person").and(contentType(APPLICATION_JSON)), request ->
			ServerResponse.ok().build(repository.save(request.bodyToMono(Person.class))));
----

For more on the functional programming model see the
https://spring.io/blog/2016/09/22/new-in-spring-5-functional-web-framework[M3 release blog post].


[[web-reactive-client]]
=== Client Side

WebFlux includes a functional, reactive `WebClient` that offers a fully
non-blocking and reactive alternative to the `RestTemplate`. It exposes network
input and output as a reactive `ClientHttpRequest` and `ClientHttpRespones` where
the body of the request and response is a `Flux<DataBuffer>` rather than an
`InputStream` and `OutputStream`. In addition it supports the same reactive JSON, XML,
and SSE serialization mechanism as on the server side so you can work with typed objects.
Below is an example of using the `WebClient` which requires a `ClientHttpConnector`
implementation to plug in a specific HTTP client such as Reactor Netty:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
WebClient client = WebClient.create("http://example.com");

Mono<Account> account = client.get()
		.url("/accounts/{id}", 1L)
		.accept(APPLICATION_JSON)
		.exchange(request)
		.then(response -> response.bodyToMono(Account.class));
----


[NOTE]
====
The `AsyncRestTemplate` also supports non-blocking interactions. The main difference
is it can't support non-blocking streaming, like for example
https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview[Twitter one], because fundamentally it's
still based and relies on `InputStream` and `OutputStream`.
====


[[web-reactive-http-body]]
=== Request and Response Body Conversion

The `spring-core` module provides reactive `Encoder` and `Decoder` contracts
that enable the serialization of a `Flux` of bytes to and from typed objects.
The `spring-web` module adds JSON (Jackson) and XML (JAXB) implementations for use in
web applications as well as others for SSE streaming and zero-copy file transfer.

For example the request body can be one of the following way and it will be decoded
automatically in both the annotation and the functional programming models:

* `Account account` -- the account is deserialized without blocking before the controller is invoked.
* `Mono<Account> account` -- the controller can use the `Mono` to declare logic to be executed after the account is deserialized.
* `Single<Account> account` -- same as with `Mono` but using RxJava
* `Flux<Account> accounts` -- input streaming scenario.
* `Observable<Account> accounts` -- input streaming with RxJava.

The response body can be one of the following:

* `Mono<Account>` -- serialize without blocking the given Account when the `Mono` completes.
* `Single<Account>` -- same but using RxJava.
* `Flux<Account>` -- streaming scenario, possibly SSE depending on the requested content type.
* `Observable<Account>` -- same but using RxJava `Observable` type.
* `Flowable<Account>` -- same but using RxJava 2 `Flowable` type.
* `Flux<ServerSentEvent>` -- SSE streaming.
* `Mono<Void>` -- request handling completes when the `Mono` completes.
* `Account` -- serialize without blocking the given Account; implies a synchronous, non-blocking controller method.
* `void` -- specific to the annotation-based programming model, request handling completes
when the method returns; implies a synchronous, non-blocking controller method.

[[web-reactive-websocket-support]]
=== Reactive WebSocket Support

WebFlux includes reactive WebSocket client and server support.
Both client and server are supported on the Java WebSocket API
(JSR-356), Jetty, Undertow, Reactor Netty, and RxNetty.

On the server side, declare a `WebSocketHandlerAdapter` and then simply add
mappings to `WebSocketHandler`-based endpoints:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Bean
public HandlerMapping webSocketMapping() {
	Map<String, WebSocketHandler> map = new HashMap<>();
	map.put("/foo", new FooWebSocketHandler());
	map.put("/bar", new BarWebSocketHandler());

	SimpleUrlHandlerMapping mapping = new SimpleUrlHandlerMapping();
	mapping.setUrlMap(map);
	return mapping;
}

@Bean
public WebSocketHandlerAdapter handlerAdapter() {
	return new WebSocketHandlerAdapter();
}
----

On the client side create a `WebSocketClient` for one of the supported libraries
listed above:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
WebSocketClient client = new ReactorNettyWebSocketClient();
client.execute("ws://localhost:8080/echo"), session -> {... }).blockMillis(5000);
----





[[web-reactive-getting-started]]
== Getting Started


[[web-reactive-getting-started-boot]]
=== Spring Boot Starter

The
https://github.com/bclozel/spring-boot-web-reactive#spring-boot-web-reactive-starter[Spring Boot Web Reactive starter]
available via http://start.spring.io is the fastest way to get started.
It does all that's necessary so you to start writing `@Controller` classes
just like with Spring MVC. Simply go to http://start.spring.io, choose
version 2.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT, and type reactive in the dependencies box.
By default the starter runs with Tomcat but the dependencies can be changed as usual with Spring Boot to switch to a different runtime.
See the
https://github.com/bclozel/spring-boot-web-reactive#spring-boot-web-reactive-starter[starter]
page for more details and instruction

There is no Spring Boot Starter for the functional programming model yet but
it's very easy to try it out. See the next section on "Manual Bootstrapping".

[[web-reactive-getting-started-manual]]
=== Manual Bootstrapping

This section outlines the steps to get up and running manually.

For dependencies start with `spring-webflux` and `spring-context`.
Then add `jackson-databind` and `io.netty:netty-buffer`
(temporarily see https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-14528[SPR-14528]) for JSON support.
Lastly add the dependencies for one of the supported runtimes:

* Tomcat -- `org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core`
* Jetty -- `org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-server` and `org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-servlet`
* Reactor Netty -- `io.projectreactor.ipc:reactor-netty`
* RxNetty -- `io.reactivex:rxnetty-common` and `io.reactivex:rxnetty-http`
* Undertow -- `io.undertow:undertow-core`

For the **annotation-based programming model** bootstrap with:
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(DelegatingWebFluxConfiguration.class);  // (1)
HttpHandler handler = DispatcherHandler.toHttpHandler(context);  // (2)
----

The above loads default Spring Web framework configuration (1), then creates a
`DispatcherHandler`, the main class driving request processing (2), and adapts
it to `HttpHandler` -- the lowest level Spring abstraction for reactive HTTP request handling.

For the **functional programming model** bootstrap as follows:
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(); // (1)
context.registerBean(FooBean.class, () -> new FooBeanImpl()); // (2)
context.registerBean(BarBean.class); // (3)

HttpHandler handler = WebHttpHandlerBuilder
		.webHandler(RouterFunctions.toHttpHandler(...))
		.applicationContext(context)
		.build(); // (4)
----

The above creates an `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` instance (1) that can take advantage
of the new functional bean registration API (2) to register beans using a Java 8 `Supplier`
or just by specifying its class (3). The `HttpHandler` is created using `WebHttpHandlerBuilder` (4).

The `HttpHandler` can then be installed in one of the supported runtimes:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
// Tomcat and Jetty (also see notes below)
HttpServlet servlet = new ServletHttpHandlerAdapter(handler);
...

// Reactor Netty
ReactorHttpHandlerAdapter adapter = new ReactorHttpHandlerAdapter(handler);
HttpServer.create(host, port).newHandler(adapter).onClose().block();

// RxNetty
RxNettyHttpHandlerAdapter adapter = new RxNettyHttpHandlerAdapter(handler);
HttpServer server = HttpServer.newServer(new InetSocketAddress(host, port));
server.startAndAwait(adapter);

// Undertow
UndertowHttpHandlerAdapter adapter = new UndertowHttpHandlerAdapter(handler);
Undertow server = Undertow.builder().addHttpListener(port, host).setHandler(adapter).build();
server.start();
----

[NOTE]
====
For Servlet containers especially with WAR deployment you can use the
`AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherHandlerInitializer` which as a
`WebApplicationInitializer` and is auto-detected by Servlet containers.
It takes care of registering the `ServletHttpHandlerAdapter` as shown above.
You will need to implement one abstract method in order to point to your
Spring configuration.
