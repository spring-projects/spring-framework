## Spring Framework
The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern
Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform. A key element of Spring is
infrastructural support at the application level: Spring focuses on the "plumbing" of enterprise
applications so that teams can focus on application-level business logic, without unnecessary ties
to specific deployment environments.

The framework also serves as the foundation for
[Spring Integration](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-integration),
[Spring Batch](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-batch) and the rest of the Spring family of
projects. Browse the repositories under the
[SpringSource organization](https://github.com/SpringSource) on GitHub for a full list.

[.NET](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-net) and
[Python](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-python) variants are available as well.
