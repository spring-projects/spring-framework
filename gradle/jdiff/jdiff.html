<BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>JDiff</b> is a Javadoc <a
href="https://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc">doclet</a> which generates an
HTML report of all the packages, classes, constructors, methods, and
fields which have been removed, added or changed in any way, including
their documentation, when two APIs are compared. This is very useful
for describing exactly what has changed between two releases of a
product. Only the API (Application Programming Interface) of each
version is compared. It does not compare what the source code does
when executed.

<H2>OVERVIEW</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The basic sequence of operations is to run JDiff on one set of source
files to create an XML file which represents the API for that version
of a product. Then JDiff is run again on another set of source files
to create an XML file which represents the API for the next version of
a product. Finally, JDiff compares the two APIs as represented in the
XML files and generates an HTML report which describes the differences
between the two APIs, together with comments describing the reasons
for the differences. This whole process can be executed as separate
Javadoc steps (either from Ant or the command line) or by simply using
the Ant JDiff task provided.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The results are written into a file called <code>changes.html</code>,
with more files in a subdirectory called <code>changes</code>.  These
files can contain links to existing Javadoc documentation. A CSS
stylesheet is also generated in the file
<code>stylesheet-jdiff.css</code>, and this uses a background image in
<code>background.gif</code>. <i>These are the only files which usually
need to be shipped with a product to include a report of what has
changed since the previous release</i>. If the <code>-stats</code>
option was used, then the file <code>black.gif</code> should also be
shipped.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is a working example of how to use JDiff in the <code>examples</code>
directory of the source distribution.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="installation"></A>
<H2>INSTALLATION</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Unpack the jdiff-1.1.1.zip file. This will produce a directory named
"jdiff-1.1.1" containing all that is necessary to use JDiff to produce
your own reports.  See the file "example.xml" in that directory for an
example of how to use the Ant JDiff task. The file "jdiff.html"
contains more information about using JDiff.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you are using the complete source distribution, then you should be
able to simply type "ant" at the top-level to produce a working
example report.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Ant JDiff task needs Ant 1.6.1 to work correctly.  Using Ant
1.5 will produce the error: 
<pre>
Error: two projects are needed, one &lt;old> and one &lt;new>
</pre>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
No Windows registry entries are changed by JDiff. To remove JDiff,
simply delete the directory where it is was unpacked.

   This should only really be necessary if the first line of a
   comment has used explicit Unicode character escape sequences which
   cannot be printed, or more importantly for JDiff, read in from XML.
   If this option is used, JDiff may fail to read in an XML
   file, and exit with an error message about "an invalid XML character (Unicode:

   The argument passed in with this causes
   JDiff to ignore program elements (packages, classes, constructors,
   methods, fields) which contain the given exclude tag in their comment blocks,
   e.g. " @exclude", " @docset Internal". The extra space in front of "@" is 
   to stop Javadoc from expanding the name into a file containing commands on
   the compile line. White space is trimmed off before the string is used.
   
   Another solution to passing "@" as part of an argument is to pass @foo,

<ul>
<li>Interfaces appear in <i>italics</i>, just as in Javadoc documentation.</li>

"constructor" after it.</li>
<li>There are some complex changes which can occur between versions, for example, when two or more methods with the same name change simultaneously, or when a method or field is moved into or from a superclass. 
In these cases, the change will be seen as a removal and an addition, rather than as a change. Unexpected removals or additions are often part of one of these type of changes.</li>
<li>With large packages, it is often necessary to change the memory parameters for

<li>The <code>api.xsd</code> template describes the format of the XML

of the XML for the comments. The API template is independent of any
related work at Sun, but the intention is to adopt whatever becomes
the <i>de facto</i> standard in the future, whilst retaining backward
compatibility. To enable validation, set the boolean <code>validateXML</code> in

<li>Comments in the comments XML file do get reordered during

</ul>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<hr>

<H2><A NAME="addingcomments"></A>ADDING COMMENTS TO A REPORT</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Comments can be added to a report by using a text editor to add text
to the "user_comments_X_to_Y.xml" file, where "X" and "Y" are the
names of the two APIs being compared. This file is automatically regenerated
each time the report is generated. 
If the <code>-d directory</code> argument is used, the user comments XML
file also appears, and is expected, in the named directory.

<p>Comments which become unused are
moved to the end of the file and placed inside XML comments. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE> The text which is added can be HTML text if necessary, but if the 
  HTML is incorrect, JDiff may fail to read the comments file and exit. Note that 
  the required HTML is in fact <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/diffs.html">XHTML</a>. Since this HTML is stored in an XML document, single tags without their closing ("slash") element are not permitted. 
  For example, most browsers permit HTML which looks like "&lt;p>Here is some 
  text.", with no closing tag. XML requires that either a closing tag exists ("&lt;/p>"), 
  or that the single tag is closed, e.g. "&lt;p/>Here is some text.". 
HTML p, br and hr tags can be single, due to common usage.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To write comments for a particular removal, addition or change in the
JDiff-generated report, edit the comments XML file. Your changes will
be automatically incorporated into a new version of this file when the
report is next generated. Search the file for the identifier for the
particular removal, addition or change, using the package name, class
name and member name to find the identifier. Alternatively, look at
the HTML source of a report and note the identifier (an HTML named anchor) 
near the intended place for the comment.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Adding links to comments can be accomplished in two ways: with the {@link} Javadoc tag, or by using HTML links directly.

<ul>

<li>
To link to a class, use the package and class name, e.g.  <nobr>{@link
packagename.classname}.</nobr> 
</li>

<li>
To link to a specific method in a class' HTML page, use the package, 
class name, a pound sign, and then the method and parameters, or ()
e.g.  <nobr>{@link packagename.classname#methodname(params)}.</nobr>
</li>

<li>
To link to a specific constructor in a class' HTML page, use the package, 
class name, a pound sign, and then the classname and parameters, or ()
e.g.  <nobr>{@link packagename.classname#classname(params)}.</nobr>
</li>

<li>
To link to a specific field in a class' HTML page, use the package, 
class name, a pound sign, and then the name of the field
e.g.  <nobr>{@link packagename.classname#fieldname}.</nobr>
</li>

</ul>

Alternatively, you can use an explicit HTML
&lt;a> element.  e.g. 
<nobr>&lt;a href="packagename.classname.html#methodname">link text&lt;a></nobr>. 
The specific HTML named anchor can be found by looking at the HTML
source of a report.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sometimes you may want to have the same comment text appear in
multiple places in the report. You can do this by having multiple
&lt;identifier> elements in a single &lt;comment> element. This
grouping does not persist after the comments file is regenerated.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The first sentence from a comment in the source code for an element is
available in the comments XML file by using the @first tag. This tag
will be replaced (once) in the comments in the report by the first
sentence from the appropriate Javadoc comment.

<H2><A NAME="differencestatistics"></A>DIFFERENCE STATISTICS</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
During the generation of a report, JDiff also reports a percentage
difference between the two APIs being compared, e.g. "Approximately
10% difference between the APIs". This statistic is calculated in the
following way:

<pre> 
Percentage change = 100 * (added + removed + 2*changed)
                    -----------------------------------
                    sum of public elements in BOTH APIs
</pre> 

So if there are 15 packages in the old API, and 2 of these are removed,
and 17 packages in the new API, 1 of which is newly added, and only 3
of which have changed, then the simple percentage difference would be:

<pre>
100 * (1 + 2 + 2*3)/ (15 + 17) = 28%
</pre>

A change of 100% means that there are no packages in common between
the two APIs. A change of 0% indicates that nothing changed between
the two APIs. This formula is applied recursively in JDiff for classes
and their members. That is, the value for the number of packages
changed is not an integer, but instead is the value obtained by
applying the same formula to the all the classes in the changed
packages, and then to all the members of the changed classes.
 This results in a lower, but more accurate, percentage difference.
The percentage difference value does not appear anywhere in the HTML
report files generated by JDiff.
The test suite for JDiff v1.0 had a difference value of approximately 63%. 
A real-world value is the value for the differences between J2SE1.2 and
J2SE1.3, which is approximately 8%.

<H2><A NAME="limitations"></A>LIMITATIONS</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<ol>
<li>While Java is highly backward compatible, so that, for example,
 the XML for a
J2SE1.2 application can be generated using JDiff with J2SE1.3, there
are a few cases where classes will appear in the XML of the API which are
not present in the source code. These classes appear to be inserted by
 <code>javac</code> or <code>javadoc</code>. An example of this is the class
<code>java.awt.Robot</code>, which is inserted into the XML for
J2SE1.2 if <code>javadoc</code> in J2SE1.3 is used, but not does not appear in
 the XML if <code>javadoc</code> in J2SE1.2 is used.<br>
To avoid these (rare) cases, it is recommended that you <i>use the same version
of the J2SE that the application was written for</i>.</li>
<li>JDiff does not tell you how two Javadoc web pages differ in layout, though
it can tell you how the content has changed.
Nor does it
compare what the methods in an API do; if JDiff could tell you what had changed about the way two
versions of an API execute, the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_Problem">Halting
Problem</a> would be solved, and our lives would be very different.</li>
<li>On a P3 450MHz machine, to scan all of the J2SE <code>Java</code> 
and <code>javax</code> packages and generate XML takes about 2 minutes
per version. To generate a report from the XML files takes about 30s</li>
