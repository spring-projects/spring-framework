/**
 * Implementation of {@link org.springframework.http.converter.HttpMessageConverter}
 * that can read and write Atom feeds. Specifically, this converter can handle {@link Feed}
 * objects from the <a href="https://github.com/rometools/rome">ROME</a> project.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE: As of Spring 4.1, this is based on the {@code com.rometools}
 * variant of ROME, version 1.5. Please upgrade your build dependency.</b>
 *
 * <p>By default, this converter reads and writes the media type ({@code application/atom+xml}).
 * This can be overridden through the {@link #setSupportedMediaTypes supportedMediaTypes} property.
