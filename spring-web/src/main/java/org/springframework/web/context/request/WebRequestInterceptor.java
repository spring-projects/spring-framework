/**
 * Interface for general web request interception. Allows for being applied
 * to Servlet request by building on the {@link WebRequest} abstraction.
 *
 * <p>This interface assumes MVC-style request processing: A handler gets executed,
 * exposes a set of model objects, then a view gets rendered based on that model.
 * Alternatively, a handler may also process the request completely, with no
 * view to be rendered.
 *
 * <p>In an async processing scenario, the handler may be executed in a separate
 * thread while the main thread exits without rendering or invoking the
 * {@code postHandle} and {@code afterCompletion} callbacks. When concurrent
 * handler execution completes, the request is dispatched back in order to
 * proceed with rendering the model and all methods of this contract are invoked
 * again. For further options and comments see
 * {@code org.springframework.web.context.request.async.AsyncWebRequestInterceptor}
 *
 * <p>This interface is deliberately minimalistic to keep the dependencies of
 * generic request interceptors as minimal as feasible.
