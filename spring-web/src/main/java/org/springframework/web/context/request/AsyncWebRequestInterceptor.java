/**
 * Extends {@code WebRequestInterceptor} with a callback method invoked during
 * asynchronous request handling.
 *
 * <p>When a handler starts asynchronous request handling, the DispatcherServlet
 * exits without invoking {@code postHandle} and {@code afterCompletion}, as it
 * normally does, since the results of request handling (for example, ModelAndView) are
 * not available in the current thread and handling is not yet complete.
 * In such scenarios, the {@link #afterConcurrentHandlingStarted(WebRequest)}
 * method is invoked instead allowing implementations to perform tasks such as
 * cleaning up thread bound attributes.
 *
 * <p>When asynchronous handling completes, the request is dispatched to the
 * container for further processing. At this stage the DispatcherServlet invokes
 * {@code preHandle}, {@code postHandle} and {@code afterCompletion} as usual.
