/**
 * Annotation that binds a method parameter or method return value
 * to a named model attribute, exposed to a web view. Supported
 * for controller classes with {@link RequestMapping @RequestMapping}
 * methods.
 *
 * <p><strong>WARNING</strong>: Data binding can lead to security issues by exposing
 * parts of the object graph that are not meant to be accessed or modified by
 * external clients. Therefore the design and use of data binding should be considered
 * carefully with regard to security. For more details, please refer to the dedicated
 * sections on data binding for
 * <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web.html#mvc-ann-initbinder-model-design">Spring Web MVC</a> and
 * <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html#webflux-ann-initbinder-model-design">Spring WebFlux</a>
 * in the reference manual.
 *
 * <p>{@code @ModelAttribute} can be used to expose command objects to a web view,
 * using specific attribute names, by annotating corresponding parameters of an
 * {@link RequestMapping @RequestMapping} method.
 *
 * <p>{@code @ModelAttribute} can also be used to expose reference data to a web
 * view by annotating accessor methods in a controller class with
 * {@link RequestMapping @RequestMapping} methods. Such accessor
 * methods are allowed to have any arguments that
 * {@link RequestMapping @RequestMapping} methods support, returning
 * the model attribute value to expose.
 *
 * <p>Note however that reference data and all other model content are
 * not available to web views when request processing results in an
 * {@code Exception} since the exception could be raised at any time
 * making the content of the model unreliable. For this reason
 * {@link ExceptionHandler @ExceptionHandler} methods do not provide
 * access to a {@link Model} argument.
