/**
 * Annotation that indicates the session attributes that a specific handler uses.
 *
 * <p>This will typically list the names of model attributes which should be
 * transparently stored in the session or some conversational storage,
 * serving as form-backing beans. <b>Declared at the type level</b>, applying
 * to the model attributes that the annotated handler class operates on.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> Session attributes as indicated using this annotation
 * correspond to a specific handler's model attributes, getting transparently
 * stored in a conversational session. Those attributes will be removed once
 * the handler indicates completion of its conversational session. Therefore,
 * use this facility for such conversational attributes which are supposed
 * to be stored in the session <i>temporarily</i> during the course of a
 * specific handler's conversation.
 *
 * <p>For permanent session attributes, for example, a user authentication object,
 * use the traditional {@code session.setAttribute} method instead.
 * Alternatively, consider using the attribute management capabilities of the
 * generic {@link org.springframework.web.context.request.WebRequest} interface.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> When using controller interfaces (for example, for AOP proxying),
 * make sure to consistently put <i>all</i> your mapping annotations &mdash;
 * such as {@code @RequestMapping} and {@code @SessionAttributes} &mdash; on
 * the controller <i>interface</i> rather than on the implementation class.
