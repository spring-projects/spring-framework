/**
 * Specialization of {@link Component @Component} for classes that declare
 * {@link ExceptionHandler @ExceptionHandler}, {@link InitBinder @InitBinder}, or
 * {@link ModelAttribute @ModelAttribute} methods to be shared across
 * multiple {@code @Controller} classes.
 *
 * <p>Classes annotated with {@code @ControllerAdvice} can be declared explicitly
 * as Spring beans or auto-detected via classpath scanning. All such beans are
 * sorted based on {@link org.springframework.core.Ordered Ordered} semantics or
 * {@link org.springframework.core.annotation.Order @Order} /
 * {@link jakarta.annotation.Priority @Priority} declarations, with {@code Ordered}
 * semantics taking precedence over {@code @Order} / {@code @Priority} declarations.
 * {@code @ControllerAdvice} beans are then applied in that order at runtime.
 * Note, however, that {@code @ControllerAdvice} beans that implement
 * {@link org.springframework.core.PriorityOrdered PriorityOrdered} are <em>not</em>
 * given priority over {@code @ControllerAdvice} beans that implement {@code Ordered}.
 * In addition, {@code Ordered} is not honored for scoped {@code @ControllerAdvice}
 * beans &mdash; for example if such a bean has been configured as a request-scoped
 * or session-scoped bean.  For handling exceptions, an {@code @ExceptionHandler}
 * will be picked on the first advice with a matching exception handler method. For
 * model attributes and data binding initialization, {@code @ModelAttribute} and
 * {@code @InitBinder} methods will follow {@code @ControllerAdvice} order.
 *
 * <p>Note: For {@code @ExceptionHandler} methods, a root exception match will be
 * preferred to just matching a cause of the current exception, among the handler
 * methods of a particular advice bean. However, a cause match on a higher-priority
 * advice will still be preferred over any match (whether root or cause level)
 * on a lower-priority advice bean. As a consequence, please declare your primary
 * root exception mappings on a prioritized advice bean with a corresponding order.
 *
 * <p>By default, the methods in an {@code @ControllerAdvice} apply globally to
 * all controllers. Use selectors such as {@link #annotations},
 * {@link #basePackageClasses}, and {@link #basePackages} (or its alias
 * {@link #value}) to define a more narrow subset of targeted controllers.
 * If multiple selectors are declared, boolean {@code OR} logic is applied, meaning
 * selected controllers should match at least one selector. Note that selector checks
 * are performed at runtime, so adding many selectors may negatively impact
 * performance and add complexity.
