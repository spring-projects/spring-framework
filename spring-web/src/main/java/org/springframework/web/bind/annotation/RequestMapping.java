/**
 * Annotation for mapping web requests onto specific handler classes and/or
 * handler methods.
 *
 * <p>Handler methods annotated with this annotation can have very flexible
 * signatures. The exact details of the supported method arguments and return
 * values depend on the specific
 * {@link org.springframework.stereotype.Controller @Controller} model supported.
 * Both Spring Web MVC and Spring WebFlux support this annotation with some
 * differences. More details are available in the Spring Framework reference.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> {@code @RequestMapping} will only be processed if an
 * an appropriate {@code HandlerMapping}-{@code HandlerAdapter} pair
 * is configured. If you are defining custom {@code HandlerMappings} or
 * {@code HandlerAdapters}, then you need to add {@code RequestMappingHandlerMapping}
 * and {@code RequestMappingHandlerAdapter} to your configuration.</code>.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> When using controller interfaces (e.g. for AOP proxying),
 * make sure to consistently put <i>all</i> your mapping annotations - such as
 * {@code @RequestMapping} and {@code @SessionAttributes} - on
 * the controller <i>interface</i> rather than on the implementation class.
