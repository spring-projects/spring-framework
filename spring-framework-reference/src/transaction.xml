    <title>Motivations</title>
    <sidebar>
      <title>Is an application server needed for transaction management?</title>
      <para>The Spring Framework's transaction management support significantly changes
      traditional thinking as to when a J2EE application requires an application
      server.</para>
      <para>In particular, you don't need an application server just to have
      declarative transactions via EJB. In fact, even if you have an application
      server with powerful JTA capabilities, you may well decide that the Spring Framework's
      declarative transactions offer more power and a much more productive
      programming model than EJB CMT.</para>
      <para>Typically you need an application server's JTA capability only if you need to
      enlist multiple transactional resources, and for many applications being able
      to handle transactions across multiple resources isn't a requirement.
      For example, many high-end applications use a single, highly scalable
      database (such as Oracle 9i RAC). Standalone transaction managers such as
      <ulink url="http://www.atomikos.com/">Atomikos Transactions</ulink> and
      <ulink url="http://jotm.objectweb.org/">JOTM</ulink> are other options. (Of course
      you may need other application server capabilities such as JMS and JCA.)</para>
      <para>The most important point is that with the Spring Framework <emphasis>you can
      choose when to scale your application up to a full-blown application
      server</emphasis>. Gone are the days when the only alternative to using
      EJB CMT or JTA was to write code using local transactions such as those
      on JDBC connections, and face a hefty rework if you ever needed that code
      to run within global, container-managed transactions. With the Spring Framework,
      only configuration needs to change so that your code doesn't have to.</para>
    </sidebar>
    <para>Traditionally, J2EE developers have had two choices for transaction
    management: <emphasis>global</emphasis> or <emphasis>local</emphasis> transactions.
    Global transactions are managed by the application server, using the Java Transaction
    API (JTA). Local transactions are resource-specific: the most common example would
    be a transaction associated with a JDBC connection. This choice has profound
    implications. For instance, global transactions provide the ability to work with multiple
    transactional resources (typically relational databases and message queues).
    With local transactions, the application server is not involved in
    transaction management and cannot help ensure correctness across multiple
    resources. (It is worth noting that most applications use a single transaction
    resource.)</para>
    <formalpara>
      <title>Global Transactions</title>
      <para>Global transactions have a significant downside, in that code needs
      to use JTA, and JTA is a cumbersome API to use (partly due to its exception
      model). Furthermore, a JTA <interfacename>UserTransaction</interfacename>
      normally needs to be sourced from JNDI: meaning that we need to use
      <emphasis>both</emphasis> JNDI <emphasis>and</emphasis> JTA to use JTA.
      Obviously all use of global transactions limits the reusability of application
      code, as JTA is normally only available in an application server environment. </para>
      <para> Previously, the preferred way to use global transactions was via EJB
      <emphasis>CMT</emphasis> (<emphasis>Container Managed Transaction</emphasis>):
      CMT is a form of <emphasis role="bold">declarative transaction management</emphasis>
      (as distinguished from <emphasis role="bold">programmatic transaction management</emphasis>).
      EJB CMT removes the need for transaction-related JNDI lookups - although of course
      the use of EJB itself necessitates the use of JNDI. It removes most of the need (although
      not entirely) to write Java code to control transactions. The significant
      downside is that CMT is tied to JTA and an application server
      environment. Also, it is only available if one chooses to implement
      business logic in EJBs, or at least behind a transactional EJB facade. The
      negatives around EJB in general are so great that this is not an
      attractive proposition, especially in the face of compelling alternatives for
      declarative transaction management.</para>
    </formalpara>
    <formalpara>
      <title>Local Transactions</title>
      <para>Local transactions may be easier to use, but have significant
      disadvantages: they cannot work across multiple transactional resources.
	    For example, code that manages transactions using a JDBC connection cannot
	    run within a global JTA transaction. Another downside is that local
	    transactions tend to be invasive to the programming model.</para>
    </formalpara>
    <para>Spring resolves these problems. It enables application developers to
    use a <emphasis>consistent</emphasis> programming model <emphasis>in any
    environment</emphasis>. You write your code once, and it can benefit from
    different transaction management strategies in different environments.
    The Spring Framework provides both declarative and programmatic transaction management.
    Declarative transaction management is preferred by most users, and is
    recommended in most cases.</para>
    <para>With programmatic transaction management, developers work with the
    Spring Framework transaction abstraction, which can run over any underlying
    transaction infrastructure. With the preferred declarative model,
    developers typically write little or no code related to transaction
    management, and hence don't depend on the Spring Framework's transaction API
    (or indeed on any other transaction API).</para>
  </section>

  <section id="transaction-strategies">
    <title>Key abstractions</title>
    <para>The key to the Spring transaction abstraction is the notion of a
    <emphasis>transaction strategy</emphasis>. A transaction strategy is
    defined by the
    <interfacename>org.springframework.transaction.PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename>
    interface, shown below:</para>
    <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public interface PlatformTransactionManager {

  TransactionStatus getTransaction(TransactionDefinition definition)
    throws TransactionException;

  void commit(TransactionStatus status) throws TransactionException;

  void rollback(TransactionStatus status) throws TransactionException;
}]]></programlisting>
    <para>This is primarily an SPI interface, although it can be used
    <link linkend="transaction-programmatic-ptm">programmatically</link>.
    Note that in keeping with the Spring Framework's philosophy,
    <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename> is
    an <emphasis>interface</emphasis>, and can thus be easily mocked or stubbed
    as necessary. Nor is it tied to a lookup strategy such as JNDI:
    <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename> implementations
    are defined like any other object (or bean) in the Spring Framework's IoC container.
    This benefit alone makes it a worthwhile abstraction even when working
    with JTA: transactional code can be tested much more easily than if it
    used JTA directly.</para>
    <para>Again in keeping with Spring's philosophy, the <exceptionname>TransactionException</exceptionname>
    that can be thrown by any of the <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename>
    interface's methods is <emphasis>unchecked</emphasis> (that is it extends the
    <exceptionname>java.lang.RuntimeException</exceptionname> class). Transaction infrastructure
    failures are almost invariably fatal. In rare cases where application code can actually
    recover from a transaction failure, the application developer can still choose to catch
    and handle <exceptionname>TransactionException</exceptionname>. The salient point is
    that developers are not <emphasis>forced</emphasis> to do so.</para>
    <para>The <methodname>getTransaction(..)</methodname> method returns a
    <interfacename>TransactionStatus</interfacename> object, depending on a
    <interfacename>TransactionDefinition</interfacename> parameter. The returned
    <interfacename>TransactionStatus</interfacename> might represent a new or
    existing transaction (if there were a matching transaction in the current
    call stack - with the implication being that (as with J2EE transaction contexts)
    a <interfacename>TransactionStatus</interfacename> is associated with a
    <emphasis role="bold">thread</emphasis> of execution).</para>
    <para>The <interfacename>TransactionDefinition</interfacename> interface specifies:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Isolation</emphasis>: the
        degree of isolation this transaction has from the work of other
        transactions. For example, can this transaction see uncommitted
        writes from other transactions?</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Propagation</emphasis>:
        normally all code executed within a transaction scope will run in that
        transaction. However, there are several options specifying behavior if
        a transactional method is executed when a transaction context already
        exists: for example, simply continue running in the existing transaction
        (the common case); or suspending the existing transaction and creating
        a new transaction. <emphasis>Spring offers all of the transaction propagation
        options familiar from EJB CMT</emphasis>. (Some details regarding the semantics of transaction
				propagation in Spring can be found in the section entitled <xref linkend="tx-propagation"/>.</para>
			</listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Timeout</emphasis>: how long
        this transaction may run before timing out (and automatically being
        rolled back by the underlying transaction infrastructure).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Read-only status</emphasis>: a read-only
        transaction does not modify any data. Read-only transactions can be a
        useful optimization in some cases (such as when using Hibernate).</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>These settings reflect standard transactional concepts. If necessary,
    please refer to a resource discussing transaction isolation levels and other
    core transaction concepts because understanding such core concepts is essential
    to using the Spring Framework or indeed any other transaction management solution.</para>
    <para>The <interfacename>TransactionStatus</interfacename> interface provides a simple
    way for transactional code to control transaction execution and query
    transaction status. The concepts should be familiar, as they are common to
    all transaction APIs:</para>
    <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public interface TransactionStatus {

  boolean isNewTransaction();

  void setRollbackOnly();

  boolean isRollbackOnly();
}]]></programlisting>
    <para>Regardless of whether you opt for declarative or programmatic transaction
    management in Spring, defining the correct
    <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename> implementation is
    absolutely essential. In good Spring fashion, this important definition typically
    is made using via Dependency Injection.</para>
    <para><interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename> implementations
    normally require knowledge of the environment in which they work: JDBC, JTA,
    Hibernate, etc The following examples from the
    <literal>dataAccessContext-local.xml</literal> file from Spring's
    <emphasis role="bold">jPetStore</emphasis> sample application show how a local
    <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename> implementation can be
    defined. (This will work with plain JDBC.)</para>
    <para>We must define a JDBC <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename>, and
    then use the Spring <classname>DataSourceTransactionManager</classname>, giving
    it a reference to the <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename>.</para>
    <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bean id="dataSource" class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource" destroy-method="close">
  <property name="driverClassName" value="${jdbc.driverClassName}" />
  <property name="url" value="${jdbc.url}" />
  <property name="username" value="${jdbc.username}" />
  <property name="password" value="${jdbc.password}" />
</bean>]]></programlisting>
    <para>The related <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename> bean
    definition will look like this:</para>
    <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bean id="txManager" class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceTransactionManager">
  <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
</bean>]]></programlisting>
    <para>If we use JTA in a J2EE container, as in the <filename>'dataAccessContext-jta.xml'</filename>
    file from the same sample application, we use a container <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename>,
    obtained via JNDI, in conjunction with Spring's <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname>.
    The <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname> doesn't need to know about the
    <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename>, or any other specific resources, as
    it will use the container's global transaction management infrastructure.</para>

      and for more information on the <literal>&lt;jee/&gt;</literal> tags
      see the section entitled <xref linkend="xsd-config-body-schemas-jee"/>.</para>
    </note>
    <para>We can also use Hibernate local transactions easily, as shown in the
    following examples from the Spring Framework's  <emphasis role="bold">PetClinic</emphasis>
    sample application. In this case, we need to define a Hibernate
    <classname>LocalSessionFactoryBean</classname>, which application code will
    use to obtain Hibernate <interfacename>Session</interfacename> instances.</para>
    <para>The <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename> bean definition will be
    similar to the one shown previously (and thus is not shown). If the
    <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename> is managed by the JEE container it should
    be non-transactional as the Spring Framework, rather than the JEE container, will
    manage transactions.</para>
    <para>The <literal>'txManager'</literal> bean in this case is of the
    <classname>HibernateTransactionManager</classname> type. In the same way as the
    <classname>DataSourceTransactionManager</classname> needs a reference to the
    <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename>, the
    <classname>HibernateTransactionManager</classname> needs a reference to the
    <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename>.</para>

    <para>With Hibernate and JTA transactions, we can simply use the
    <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname> as with JDBC or any other resource strategy.</para>
    <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bean id="txManager" class="org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager"/>]]></programlisting>
    <para>Note that this is identical to JTA configuration for any resource,
    as these are global transactions, which can enlist any transactional
    resource.</para>
    <remark>
      <para>In all these cases, application code will not need to change at
      all. We can change how transactions are managed merely by changing
      configuration, even if that change means moving from local to global
      transactions or vice versa.</para>
    </remark>
  </section>

  <section id="tx-resource-synchronization">
    <title>Resource synchronization with transactions</title>
    <para>It should now be clear how different transaction managers are
    created, and how they are linked to related resources which need to be
    synchronized to transactions (for example <classname>DataSourceTransactionManager</classname>
    to a JDBC <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename>,
    <classname>HibernateTransactionManager</classname> to a Hibernate
    <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename>, and so forth). There remains the question
    however of how the application code, directly or indirectly using a
    persistence API (such as JDBC, Hibernate, and JDO), ensures that these resources
    are obtained and handled properly in terms of proper
    creation/reuse/cleanup and trigger (optionally) transaction
    synchronization via the relevant <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename>.</para>

    <section id="tx-resource-synchronization-high">
      <title>High-level approach</title>
      <para>The preferred approach is to use Spring's highest level
      persistence integration APIs. These do not replace the native APIs, but
      internally handle resource creation/reuse, cleanup, optional
      transaction synchronization of the resources and exception mapping so
      that user data access code doesn't have to worry about these concerns at
      all, but can concentrate purely on non-boilerplate persistence logic.
      Generally, the same <emphasis>template</emphasis> approach is used
      for all persistence APIs, with examples including the
      <classname>JdbcTemplate</classname>, <classname>HibernateTemplate</classname>,
      and <classname>JdoTemplate</classname> classes (detailed in subsequent chapters
      of this reference documentation.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="tx-resource-synchronization-low">
      <title>Low-level approach</title>
      <para>At a lower level exist classes such as
      <classname>DataSourceUtils</classname> (for JDBC),
      <classname>SessionFactoryUtils</classname> (for Hibernate),
      <classname>PersistenceManagerFactoryUtils</classname> (for JDO), and so on.
      When it is preferable for application code to deal directly with the
      resource types of the native persistence APIs, these classes ensure that
      proper Spring Framework-managed instances are obtained, transactions are
      (optionally) synchronized, and exceptions which happen in the process
      are properly mapped to a consistent API.</para>
      <para>For example, in the case of JDBC, instead of the traditional JDBC approach of
      calling the <literal>getConnection()</literal> method on the
      <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename>, you would instead use Spring's
      <classname>org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceUtils</classname>
      class as follows:</para>
      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[Connection conn = DataSourceUtils.getConnection(dataSource);]]></programlisting>
      <para>If an existing transaction exists, and already has a connection
      synchronized (linked) to it, that instance will be returned. Otherwise,
      the method call will trigger the creation of a new connection, which
      will be (optionally) synchronized to any existing transaction, and
      made available for subsequent reuse in that same transaction. As mentioned,
      this has the added advantage that any <exceptionname>SQLException</exceptionname>
      will be wrapped in a Spring Framework
      <exceptionname>CannotGetJdbcConnectionException</exceptionname> - one of the Spring
      Framework's hierarchy of unchecked DataAccessExceptions. This gives you more
      information than can easily be obtained from the
      <exceptionname>SQLException</exceptionname>, and ensures portability across
      databases: even across different persistence technologies.</para>
      <para>It should be noted that this will also work fine without Spring
      transaction management (transaction synchronization is optional), so you
      can use it whether or not you are using Spring for transaction
      management.</para>
      <para>Of course, once you've used Spring's JDBC support or Hibernate
      support, you will generally prefer not to use
      <classname>DataSourceUtils</classname> or the other helper classes, because
      you'll be much happier working via the Spring abstraction than directly
      with the relevant APIs. For example, if you use the Spring
      <classname>JdbcTemplate</classname> or <literal>jdbc.object</literal>
      package to simplify your use of JDBC, correct connection retrieval happens
      behind the scenes and you won't need to write any special code.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="tx-resource-synchronization-tadsp">
      <title><classname>TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy</classname></title>
      <para>At the very lowest level exists the
      <classname>TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy</classname> class. This is a
      proxy for a target <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename>, which wraps the
      target <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename> to add awareness of Spring-managed
      transactions. In this respect, it is similar to a transactional JNDI
      <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename> as provided by a J2EE server.</para>
      <para>It should almost never be necessary or desirable to use this
      class, except when existing code exists which must be called and passed
      a standard JDBC <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename> interface implementation.
      In that case, it's possible to still have this code be usable, but
      participating in Spring managed transactions. It is preferable to write
      your new code using the higher level abstractions mentioned
      above.</para>

  <section id="transaction-declarative">
    <title>Declarative transaction management</title>
    <remark>Most users of the Spring Framework choose declarative transaction management.
		It is the option with the least impact on application code, and hence is most
    consistent with the ideals of a <emphasis>non-invasive</emphasis>
    lightweight container.</remark>
    <para>The Spring Framework's declarative transaction management is made possible

    <para>It may be helpful to begin by considering EJB CMT and explaining the
    similarities and differences with the Spring Framework's declarative transaction
    management. The basic approach is similar: it is possible to specify
    transaction behavior (or lack of it) down to individual method level. It is
    possible to make a <methodname>setRollbackOnly()</methodname> call within a
    transaction context if necessary. The differences are:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Unlike EJB CMT, which is tied to JTA, the Spring Framework's

		<title>Where is <classname>TransactionProxyFactoryBean</classname>?</title>
      <para>Declarative transaction configuration in versions of Spring 2.0 and above
      differs considerably from previous versions of Spring. The main difference is
      that there is no longer any need to configure
      <classname>TransactionProxyFactoryBean</classname> beans.</para>
      <para>The old, pre-Spring 2.0 configuration style is still 100%
      valid configuration; think of the new <literal>&lt;tx:tags/&gt;</literal>
      as simply defining <classname>TransactionProxyFactoryBean</classname> beans
      on your behalf.</para>
    </sidebar>
    <para>The concept of rollback rules is important: they enable us to
    specify which exceptions (and throwables) should cause automatic roll
    back. We specify this declaratively, in configuration, not in Java code.
    So, while we can still call <methodname>setRollbackOnly()</methodname>on the
    <interfacename>TransactionStatus</interfacename> object to roll the current
    transaction back programmatically, most often we can specify a rule that
    <exceptionname>MyApplicationException</exceptionname> must always result in
    rollback. This has the significant advantage that business objects don't need
    to depend on the transaction infrastructure. For example, they typically
    don't need to import any Spring APIs, transaction or other.</para>
    <para>While the EJB default behavior is for the EJB container to
    automatically roll back the transaction on a <emphasis>system
    exception</emphasis> (usually a runtime exception), EJB CMT does not roll
    back the transaction automatically on an <emphasis>application exception</emphasis>
    (that is, a checked exception other than <exceptionname>java.rmi.RemoteException</exceptionname>).
    While the Spring default behavior for declarative transaction management follows
    EJB convention (roll back is automatic only on unchecked exceptions), it is often
		useful to customize this.</para>

      <title>Understanding the Spring Framework's declarative transaction implementation</title>
      <para>The aim of this section is to dispel the mystique that is sometimes associated
			with the use of declarative transactions. It is all very well for this reference
			documentation simply to tell you to annotate your classes with the
			<interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename> annotation, add the line
			(<literal>'&lt;tx:annotation-driven/&gt;'</literal>) to your configuration,
      and then expect you to understand how it all works. This section will explain the
			inner workings of the Spring Framework's declarative transaction infrastructure to
			help you navigate your way back upstream to calmer waters in the event of
			transaction-related issues.</para>
      <para>The most important concepts to grasp with regard to the Spring Framework's
			declarative transaction support are that this support is enabled
      <link linkend="aop-understanding-aop-proxies"><emphasis>via AOP proxies</emphasis></link>,
      and that the transactional advice is driven by <emphasis>metadata</emphasis> (currently
      XML- or annotation-based). The combination of AOP with transactional metadata yields
      an AOP proxy that uses a <classname>TransactionInterceptor</classname> in conjunction
      with an appropriate <classname>PlatformTransactionManager</classname> implementation
      to drive transactions <emphasis>around method invocations</emphasis>.</para>
      <note>
        <para>Although knowledge of Spring AOP is not required to use Spring's declarative

      <para>Let's pick apart the above configuration. We have a service object
      (the <literal>'fooService'</literal> bean) that we want to make transactional.
      The transaction semantics that we want to apply are encapsulated in the
      <literal>&lt;tx:advice/&gt;</literal> definition. The
      <literal>&lt;tx:advice/&gt;</literal> definition reads as
      <quote><emphasis>... all methods on starting with <literal>'get'</literal> are to execute
      in the context of a read-only transaction, and all other methods are to execute
      with the default transaction semantics</emphasis></quote>. The
      <literal>'transaction-manager'</literal> attribute of the
      <literal>&lt;tx:advice/&gt;</literal> tag is set to the
      name of the <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename> bean
      that is going to actually <emphasis>drive</emphasis> the transactions (in this
      case the <literal>'txManager'</literal> bean).</para>
      <tip>
        <para>You can actually omit the <literal>'transaction-manager'</literal>
        attribute in the transactional advice (<literal>&lt;tx:advice/&gt;</literal>)
        if the bean name of the <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename>
        that you want to wire in has the name <literal>'transactionManager'</literal>.
        If the <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename> bean
        that you want to wire in has any other name, then you have to be explicit
        and use the <literal>'transaction-manager'</literal> attribute as in the example above.</para>
      </tip>
      <para>The <literal>&lt;aop:config/&gt;</literal> definition ensures that the transactional
      advice defined by the <literal>'txAdvice'</literal> bean actually executes at the appropriate
      points in the program. First we define a pointcut that matches the execution of any
      operation defined in the <interfacename>FooService</interfacename> interface
      (<literal>'fooServiceOperation'</literal>). Then we associate the pointcut with the
      <literal>'txAdvice'</literal> using an advisor. The result indicates that at the execution
      of a <literal>'fooServiceOperation'</literal>, the advice defined by <literal>'txAdvice'</literal>
      will be run.</para>
      <para>The expression defined within the <literal>&lt;aop:pointcut/&gt;</literal>
      element is an AspectJ pointcut expression; see the chapter entitled <xref linkend="aop"/>
      for more details on pointcut expressions in Spring 2.0.</para>
      <para>A common requirement is to make an entire service layer transactional.
      The best way to do this is simply to change the pointcut expression to match
      any operation in your service layer. For example:</para>
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<aop:config>
  <aop:pointcut id="fooServiceMethods" expression="execution(* x.y.service.*.*(..))"/>
  <aop:advisor advice-ref="txAdvice" pointcut-ref="fooServiceMethods"/>
  </aop:config>]]></programlisting>
      <para><emphasis>(This example assumes that all your service interfaces are defined
      in the <literal>'x.y.service'</literal> package; see the chapter entitled
      <xref linkend="aop"/> for more details.)</emphasis></para>
      <para>Now that we've analyzed the configuration, you may be asking
      yourself, <quote><emphasis>Okay... but what does all this configuration actually
      do?</emphasis></quote>.</para>
      <para>The above configuration is going to effect the creation of a
      transactional proxy around the object that is created from the
      <literal>'fooService'</literal> bean definition. The proxy will be configured
      with the transactional advice, so that when an appropriate method is invoked
      <emphasis>on the proxy</emphasis>, a transaction <emphasis>may</emphasis>
      be started, suspended, be marked as read-only, etc., depending on the
      transaction configuration associated with that method. Consider the following
			program that test drives the above configuration.</para>
      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public final class Boot {

  public static void main(final String[] args) throws Exception {
    ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("context.xml", Boot.class);
    FooService fooService = (FooService) ctx.getBean("fooService");
    fooService.insertFoo (new Foo());
  }

    <section id="transaction-declarative-rolling-back">
      <title>Rolling back</title>
      <para>The previous section outlined the basics of how to specify the transactional
      settings for the classes, typically service layer classes, in your application in a
      declarative fashion. This section describes how you can control the rollback of
      transactions in a simple declarative fashion.</para>
      <para>The recommended way to indicate to the Spring Framework's
      transaction infrastructure that a transaction's work is to be rolled back is to
      throw an <exceptionname>Exception</exceptionname> from code that is currently
      executing in the context of a transaction. The Spring Framework's
      transaction infrastructure code will catch any unhandled
			<exceptionname>Exception</exceptionname> as it bubbles up the call stack, and will
			mark the transaction for rollback.</para>
      <para>Note however that the Spring Framework's transaction infrastructure
			code will, by default, <emphasis>only</emphasis> mark a transaction for rollback in
			the case of runtime, unchecked exceptions; that is, when the thrown exception is an
			instance or subclass of <exceptionname>RuntimeException</exceptionname>.
			(<literal>Errors</literal> will also - by default - result in a rollback.) Checked
			exceptions that are thrown from a transactional method will
      <emphasis>not</emphasis> result in the transaction being rolled back.</para>
      <para>Exactly which <exceptionname>Exception</exceptionname> types mark a transaction
			for rollback can be configured. Find below a snippet of XML configuration that
			demonstrates how one would configure rollback for a checked, application-specific
			<exceptionname>Exception</exceptionname> type.</para>
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<tx:advice id="txAdvice" transaction-manager="txManager">
  <tx:attributes>
  <tx:method name="get*" read-only="true" ]]><lineannotation><emphasis role="bold">rollback-for="NoProductInStockException"</emphasis></lineannotation><![CDATA[/>
  <tx:method name="*"/>
  </tx:attributes>
</tx:advice>]]></programlisting>
			<para>It is also possible to specify 'no rollback rules', for those times when you do
			<emphasis>not</emphasis> want a transaction to be marked for rollback when an exception is thrown.
			In the example configuration below, we effectively are telling the Spring Framework's transaction
			infrastructure to commit the attendant transaction even in the face of an unhandled
			<exceptionname>InstrumentNotFoundException</exceptionname>.</para>
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<tx:advice id="txAdvice">
  <tx:attributes>
  <tx:method name="updateStock" ]]><lineannotation><emphasis role="bold">no-rollback-for="InstrumentNotFoundException"</emphasis></lineannotation><![CDATA[/>
  <tx:method name="*"/>
  </tx:attributes>
</tx:advice>]]></programlisting>
			<para>When the Spring Framework's transaction infrastructure has caught an exception and is consulting
			any configured rollback rules to determine whether or not to mark the transaction for rollback, the
			<emphasis>strongest</emphasis> matching rule wins. So in the case of the following configuration,
			any exception other than an <exceptionname>InstrumentNotFoundException</exceptionname> would result in the
			attendant transaction being marked for rollback.</para>
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<tx:advice id="txAdvice">
  <tx:attributes>
  <tx:method name="*" rollback-for="Throwable" no-rollback-for="InstrumentNotFoundException"/>
  </tx:attributes>
</tx:advice>]]></programlisting>
			<para>The second way to indicate that a rollback is required is to do so
			<emphasis>programmatically</emphasis>. Although very simple, this way is quite invasive, and tightly couples
			your code to the Spring Framework's transaction infrastructure, as can be seen below:</para>
      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public void resolvePosition() {
  try {
    ]]><lineannotation>// some business logic...</lineannotation><![CDATA[
  } catch (NoProductInStockException ex) {
    ]]><lineannotation>// trigger rollback programmatically</lineannotation><![CDATA[
    TransactionAspectSupport.currentTransactionStatus().setRollbackOnly();
  }
}]]></programlisting>
      <para>You are strongly encouraged to use the declarative approach to rollback if at all possible.
			Programmatic rollback is available should you absolutely need it, but its usage flies in the face of
			achieving a nice, clean POJO-based architecture.</para>

      <title>Using <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename></title>
			<note>
				<para>The functionality offered by the <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename>
				annotation and the support classes is only available to you if you
				are using at least Java 5 (Tiger).</para>
			</note>
      <para>In addition to the XML-based declarative approach to transaction configuration,
      you can also use an annotation-based approach to transaction configuration. Declaring
      transaction semantics directly in the Java source code puts the declarations much
      closer to the affected code, and there is generally not much danger of undue coupling,
      since code that is meant to be used transactionally is almost always deployed that way
      anyway.</para>
      <para>The ease-of-use afforded by the use of the <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename>
      annotation is best illustrated with an example, after which all of the details
      will be explained. Consider the following class definition:</para>
      <programlisting language="java"><lineannotation>// the service class that we want to make transactional</lineannotation><![CDATA[
]]><emphasis role="bold">@Transactional</emphasis><![CDATA[
public class DefaultFooService implements FooService {

  Foo getFoo(String fooName);

  Foo getFoo(String fooName, String barName);

  void insertFoo(Foo foo);

  void updateFoo(Foo foo);
}]]></programlisting>
      <para>When the above POJO is defined as a bean in a Spring IoC container, the bean
      instance can be made transactional by adding merely <emphasis>one</emphasis> line of
      XML configuration, like so:</para>
      <programlisting language="xml"><lineannotation>&lt;!-- from the file <literal>'context.xml'</literal> --&gt;</lineannotation><![CDATA[

      <tip>
        <para>You can actually omit the <literal>'transaction-manager'</literal>
        attribute in the <literal>&lt;tx:annotation-driven/&gt;</literal> tag
        if the bean name of the <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename>
        that you want to wire in has the name <literal>'transactionManager'</literal>.
        If the <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename> bean
        that you want to dependency inject has any other name, then you have to be
        explicit and use the <literal>'transaction-manager'</literal> attribute as
        in the example above.</para>
      </tip>
      <sidebar>
        <title>Method visibility and <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename></title>
        <para>When using proxies, the <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename> annotation
        should only be applied to methods with <emphasis>public</emphasis> visibility.
        If you do annotate protected, private or package-visible methods with the
        <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename> annotation, no error will be raised,
        but the annotated method will not exhibit the configured transactional settings.
        Consider the use of AspectJ (see below) if you need to annotate non-public methods.</para>
      </sidebar>
      <para>The <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename> annotation may be placed
      before an interface definition, a method on an interface, a class definition, or a
      <emphasis>public</emphasis> method on a class. However, please note that the mere
      presence of the <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename> annotation is not
      enough to actually turn on the transactional behavior - the
      <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename> annotation <emphasis>is simply metadata</emphasis>
      that can be consumed by something that is <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename>-aware
      and that can use the metadata to configure the appropriate beans with transactional
      behavior. In the case of the above example, it is the presence of the
      <literal>&lt;tx:annotation-driven/&gt;</literal> element that
      <emphasis>switches on</emphasis> the transactional behavior.</para>

      <para>The Spring team's recommendation is that you only annotate concrete
      classes with the <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename> annotation,
      as opposed to annotating interfaces. You certainly can place the
      <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename> annotation on an interface (or
      an interface method), but this will only work as you would expect it to if
      you are using interface-based proxies. The fact that annotations are
      <emphasis>not inherited</emphasis> means that if you are using class-based
      proxies (<literal>proxy-target-class="true"</literal>) or the weaving-based aspect
      (<literal>mode="aspectj"</literal>) then the transaction settings will not be
      recognised by the proxying/weaving infrastructure and the object will not be
      wrapped in a transactional proxy (which would be decidedly <emphasis>bad</emphasis>).
      So please do take the Spring team's advice and only annotate concrete classes
      (and the methods of concrete classes) with the
      <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename> annotation.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Note: In proxy mode (which is the default), only 'external'
      method calls coming in through the proxy will be intercepted.</emphasis>
      This means that 'self-invocation', i.e. a method within the target object
      calling some other method of the target object, won't lead to an actual
      transaction at runtime even if the invoked method is marked with
      <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename>!</para>

      <para>Consider the use of AspectJ mode (see below) if you expect
      self-invocations to be wrapped with transactions as well. In this case,
      there won't be a proxy in the first place; instead, the target class
      will be 'weaved' (i.e. its byte code will be modified) in order to
      turn <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename> into runtime behavior
      on any kind of method.</para>

				<para>Currently it is not possible to have explicit control over the name of a transaction, where

				transactionally-advised class. For example, if the <methodname>handlePayment(..)</methodname>

			<para><emphasis>Please note that this section of the Spring reference documentation is
			<emphasis>not</emphasis> an introduction to transaction propagation proper; rather it details some of the
			semantics regarding transaction propagation in Spring.</emphasis></para>
			<para>In the case of Spring-managed transactions, please be aware of the difference between
			<emphasis>physical</emphasis> and <emphasis>logical</emphasis> transactions, and how the propagation
			setting applies to this difference.</para>

				</para>
				<para>When the propagation setting is <literal>PROPAGATION_REQUIRED</literal>, a
				<emphasis>logical</emphasis> transaction scope is created for each method that it gets applied to. Each
				such logical transaction scope can individually decide on rollback-only status, with an outer
				transaction scope being logically independent from the inner transaction scope. Of course, in case of
				standard <literal>PROPAGATION_REQUIRED</literal> behavior, they will be mapped to the same physical
				transaction. So a rollback-only marker set in the inner transaction scope does affect the outer
				transactions chance to actually commit (as you would expect it to).</para>
				<para>However, in the case where an inner transaction scopes sets the rollback-only marker, the outer
				transaction itself has not decided on the rollback itself, and so the rollback (silently triggered by
				the inner transaction scope) is unexpected: a corresponding
				<classname>UnexpectedRollbackException</classname> will be thrown at that point. This is
				<emphasis>expected behavior</emphasis> so that the caller of a transaction can never be misled to assume
				that a commit was performed when it really was not. So if an inner transaction (that the outer caller is
				not aware of) silently marks a transaction as rollback-only, the outer caller would still innocently
				call commit - and needs to receive an <classname>UnexpectedRollbackException</classname> to indicate
				clearly that a rollback was performed instead.</para>

						</caption>
					</mediaobject>
				</para>
				<para><literal>PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW</literal>, in contrast, uses a <emphasis>completely</emphasis>
				independent transaction for each affected transaction scope. In that case, the underlying physical
				transactions will be different and hence can commit or rollback independently, with an outer transaction
				not affected by an inner transaction's rollback status.</para>
			</section>

			<section id="tx-propagation-nested">
				<title>Nested</title>
				<para><literal>PROPAGATION_NESTED</literal> is different again in that it uses a
				<emphasis>single</emphasis> physical transaction with multiple savepoints that it can roll back to.
				Such partial rollbacks allow an inner transaction scope to trigger a rollback
				<emphasis>for its scope</emphasis>, with the outer transaction being able to continue the physical
				transaction despite some operations having been rolled back. This is typically mapped onto JDBC
				savepoints, so will only work with JDBC resource transactions (see Spring's

      by means of an AspectJ aspect. To use this support you must first

      (weave) your application with the

      defined in the <filename class="libraryfile">spring-aspects.jar</filename> file.
      The aspect must also be configured with a transaction manager. You could of course
      use the Spring Framework's IoC container to take care of dependency injecting the
      aspect.  The simplest way to

  <section id="tx-decl-vs-prog">
    <title>Choosing between programmatic and declarative transaction management</title>
    <para>Programmatic transaction management is usually a good idea only if
    you have a small number of transactional operations. For example, if you
    have a web application that require transactions only for certain update
    operations, you may not want to set up transactional proxies using Spring
    or any other technology. In this case, using the <classname>TransactionTemplate</classname>
    <emphasis>may</emphasis> be a good approach. Being able to set the transaction name
		explicitly is also something that can only be done using the programmatic
		approach to transaction management.</para>
    <para>On the other hand, if your application has numerous transactional
    operations, declarative transaction management is usually worthwhile. It
    keeps transaction management out of business logic, and is not difficult
    to configure. When using the Spring Framework, rather than EJB CMT, the
    configuration cost of declarative transaction management is greatly reduced.</para>

  <section id="transaction-application-server-integration">
    <title>Application server-specific integration</title>
    <para>Spring's transaction abstraction generally is application server
    agnostic. Additionally, Spring's <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname> class,
    which can optionally perform a JNDI lookup for the JTA
    <interfacename>UserTransaction</interfacename> and
    <interfacename>TransactionManager</interfacename> objects, autodetects
    the location for the latter object, which varies by application server. Having
    access to the JTA <interfacename>TransactionManager</interfacename> allows for
    enhanced transaction semantics, in particular supporting transaction suspension.
    Please see the <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname> Javadocs for details.
    </para>
    <para>Spring's <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname> is the standard
    choice when running on J2EE application servers, known to work on all common
    servers. Its advanced functionality such as transaction suspension is known to
    work on many servers as well - including GlassFish, JBoss, Geronimo and Oracle
    OC4J - without any special configuration required. However, for fully supported
    transaction suspension and further advanced integration, Spring ships special
    adapters for IBM WebSphere and BEA WebLogic and also for Oracle OC4J.
    We'll discuss these adapters in the following sections.</para>
    <para><emphasis>For standard scenarios, including WebLogic, WebSphere and OC4J,
    consider using the convenient <literal>'&lt;tx:jta-transaction-manager/&gt;'</literal>
    configuration element.</emphasis> This will automatically detect the underlying
    server and choose the best transaction manager available for the platform.
    This means that you won't have to configure server-specific adapter classes
    (as discussed in the following sections) explicitly; they will rather be chosen
    automatically, with the standard <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname>
    as default fallback.</para>

    <section id="transaction-application-server-integration-websphere">
      <title>IBM WebSphere</title>
      <para>On WebSphere 6.0 and above, the recommended Spring JTA transaction
      manager to use is <classname>WebSphereUowTransactionManager</classname>.
      This special adapter leverages IBM's <interfacename>UOWManager</interfacename>
      API which is available in WebSphere Application Server 6.0.2.19 or above
      and 6.1.0.9 or above. With this adapter, Spring-driven transaction suspension
      (suspend/resume as initiated by <literal>PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW</literal>)
      is officially supported by IBM!</para>
      <para>In a WebSphere 5.1 environment, you may wish to use
      Spring's <classname>WebSphereTransactionManagerFactoryBean</classname>
      class. This is a factory bean which retrieves the JTA
      <interfacename>TransactionManager</interfacename> in a WebSphere environment, which
      is done via WebSphere's <literal>static</literal> access methods.
      Once the JTA <interfacename>TransactionManager</interfacename> instance has
      been obtained via this factory bean, Spring's
      <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname> may be configured with a
      reference to it, for enhanced transaction semantics over the use of only
      the JTA <interfacename>UserTransaction</interfacename> object.
      Please see the Javadocs for full details.</para>
      <para><emphasis>Note that <classname>WebSphereTransactionManagerFactoryBean</classname>
      usage is known to work on WAS 5.1 and 6.0 but is not officially supported
      by IBM.</emphasis> Prefer <classname>WebSphereUowTransactionManager</classname>
      when running on WAS 6.0 or higher (see above).</para>

    <section id="transaction-application-server-integration-weblogic">
      <title>BEA WebLogic</title>
      <para>On WebLogic 8.1 or above, you will generally prefer to use
			the <classname>WebLogicJtaTransactionManager</classname> instead
      of the stock <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname> class.
      This special WebLogic-specific subclass of the normal
      <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname> supports the full power of
      Spring's transaction definitions in a WebLogic-managed transaction environment,
      beyond standard JTA semantics: Features include transaction names, per-transaction
      isolation levels, and proper resuming of transactions in all cases.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="transaction-application-server-integration-oc4j">
      <title>Oracle OC4J</title>
      <para>Spring ships a special adapter class for OC4J 10.1.3 or above:
			<classname>OC4JJtaTransactionManager</classname>. This is analogous to
      the <classname>WebLogicJtaTransactionManager</classname> class discussed
      in the previous section, providing similar value-adds on OC4J:
      transaction names and per-transaction isolation levels.</para>
      <para>Note that the full JTA functionality, including transaction suspension,
      works fine with Spring's <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname> on
      OC4J as well. The special <classname>OC4JJtaTransactionManager</classname>
      adapter simply provides value-adds beyond standard JTA.</para>
