  <title>Object Relational Mapping (ORM) data access</title>

  <section id="orm-introduction">
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>The Spring Framework provides integration with <emphasis>Hibernate,
    JDO, Oracle TopLink, iBATIS SQL Maps</emphasis> and
    <emphasis>JPA</emphasis>: in terms of resource management, DAO
    implementation support, and transaction strategies. For example for
    Hibernate, there is first-class support with lots of IoC convenience
    features, addressing many typical Hibernate integration issues. All of
    these support packages for O/R (Object Relational) mappers comply with
    Spring's generic transaction and DAO exception hierarchies. There are
    usually two integration styles: either using Spring's DAO 'templates' or
    coding DAOs against plain Hibernate/JDO/TopLink/etc APIs. In both cases,
    DAOs can be configured through Dependency Injection and participate in
    Spring's resource and transaction management.</para>

    <para>Spring adds significant support when using the O/R mapping layer of
    your choice to create data access applications. First of all, you should
    know that once you started using Spring's support for O/R mapping, you
    don't have to go all the way. No matter to what extent, you're invited to
    review and leverage the Spring approach, before deciding to take the
    effort and risk of building a similar infrastructure in-house. Much of the
    O/R mapping support, no matter what technology you're using may be used in
    a library style, as everything is designed as a set of reusable JavaBeans.
    Usage inside a Spring IoC container does provide additional benefits in
    terms of ease of configuration and deployment; as such, most examples in
    this section show configuration inside a Spring container.</para>

    <para>Some of the benefits of using the Spring Framework to create your
    ORM DAOs include:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Ease of testing.</emphasis> Spring's IoC approach
        makes it easy to swap the implementations and config locations of
        Hibernate <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename> instances,
        JDBC <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename> instances, transaction
        managers, and mappes object implementations (if needed). This makes it
        much easier to isolate and test each piece of persistence-related code
        in isolation.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Common data access exceptions.</emphasis> Spring can
        wrap exceptions from your O/R mapping tool of choice, converting them
        from proprietary (potentially checked) exceptions to a common runtime
        DataAccessException hierarchy. This allows you to handle most
        persistence exceptions, which are non-recoverable, only in the
        appropriate layers, without annoying boilerplate catches/throws, and
        exception declarations. You can still trap and handle exceptions
        anywhere you need to. Remember that JDBC exceptions (including DB
        specific dialects) are also converted to the same hierarchy, meaning
        that you can perform some operations with JDBC within a consistent
        programming model.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>General resource management.</emphasis> Spring
        application contexts can handle the location and configuration of
        Hibernate <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename> instances,
        JDBC <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename> instances, iBATIS SQL
        Maps configuration objects, and other related resources. This makes
        these values easy to manage and change. Spring offers efficient, easy
        and safe handling of persistence resources. For example: related code
        using Hibernate generally needs to use the same Hibernate
        <interfacename>Session</interfacename> for efficiency and proper
        transaction handling. Spring makes it easy to transparently create and
        bind a <interfacename>Session</interfacename> to the current thread,
        either by using an explicit 'template' wrapper class at the Java code
        level or by exposing a current <interfacename>Session</interfacename>
        through the Hibernate <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename>
        (for DAOs based on plain Hibernate API). Thus Spring solves many of
        the issues that repeatedly arise from typical Hibernate usage, for any
        transaction environment (local or JTA).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Integrated transaction management.</emphasis> Spring
        allows you to wrap your O/R mapping code with either a declarative,
        AOP style method interceptor, or an explicit 'template' wrapper class
        at the Java code level. In either case, transaction semantics are
        handled for you, and proper transaction handling (rollback, etc) in
        case of exceptions is taken care of. As discussed below, you also get
        the benefit of being able to use and swap various transaction
        managers, without your Hibernate/JDO related code being affected: for
        example, between local transactions and JTA, with the same full
        services (such as declarative transactions) available in both
        scenarios. As an additional benefit, JDBC-related code can fully
        integrate transactionally with the code you use to do O/R mapping.
        This is useful for data access that's not suitable for O/R mapping,
        such as batch processing or streaming of BLOBs, which still needs to
        share common transactions with ORM operations.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The PetClinic sample in the Spring distribution offers alternative
    DAO implementations and application context configurations for JDBC,
    Hibernate, Oracle TopLink, and JPA. PetClinic can therefore serve as
    working sample app that illustrates the use of Hibernate, TopLink and JPA
    in a Spring web application. It also leverages declarative transaction
    demarcation with different transaction strategies.</para>

    <para>The JPetStore sample illustrates the use of iBATIS SQL Maps in a
    Spring environment. It also features two web tier versions: one based on
    Spring Web MVC, one based on Struts.</para>

    <para>Beyond the samples shipped with Spring, there are a variety of
    Spring-based O/R mapping samples provided by specific vendors: for
    example, the JDO implementations JPOX (<ulink
    url="http://www.jpox.org/"></ulink>) and Kodo (<ulink
    url="http://www.bea.com/kodo/"></ulink>).</para>

  <section id="orm-hibernate">
    <title>Hibernate</title>

    <para>We will start with a coverage of <ulink
    url="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate 3</ulink> in a Spring
    environment, using it to demonstrate the approach that Spring takes
    towards integrating O/R mappers. This section will cover many issues in
    detail and show different variations of DAO implementations and
    transaction demarcation. Most of these patterns can be directly translated
    to all other supported ORM tools. The following sections in this chapter
    will then cover the other ORM technologies, showing briefer examples
    there.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Note: As of Spring 2.5, Spring requires Hibernate 3.1 or
    higher. Neither Hibernate 2.1 nor Hibernate 3.0 are supported
    anymore.</emphasis></para>

    <section id="orm-resource-mngmnt">
      <title>Resource management</title>

      <para>Typical business applications are often cluttered with repetitive
      resource management code. Many projects try to invent their own
      solutions for this issue, sometimes sacrificing proper handling of
      failures for programming convenience. Spring advocates strikingly simple
      solutions for proper resource handling, namely IoC via templating; for
      example infrastructure classes with callback interfaces, or applying AOP
      interceptors. The infrastructure cares for proper resource handling, and
      for appropriate conversion of specific API exceptions to an unchecked
      infrastructure exception hierarchy. Spring introduces a DAO exception
      hierarchy, applicable to any data access strategy. For direct JDBC, the
      <classname>JdbcTemplate</classname> class mentioned in a previous
      section cares for connection handling, and for proper conversion of
      <classname>SQLException</classname> to the
      <classname>DataAccessException</classname> hierarchy, including
      translation of database-specific SQL error codes to meaningful exception
      classes. It supports both JTA and JDBC transactions, via respective
      Spring transaction managers.</para>

      <para>Spring also offers Hibernate and JDO support, consisting of a
      <classname>HibernateTemplate</classname> /
      <classname>JdoTemplate</classname> analogous to
      <classname>JdbcTemplate</classname>, a
      <classname>HibernateInterceptor</classname> /
      <classname>JdoInterceptor</classname>, and a Hibernate / JDO transaction
      manager. The major goal is to allow for clear application layering, with
      any data access and transaction technology, and for loose coupling of
      application objects. No more business service dependencies on the data
      access or transaction strategy, no more hard-coded resource lookups, no
      more hard-to-replace singletons, no more custom service registries. One
      simple and consistent approach to wiring up application objects, keeping
      them as reusable and free from container dependencies as possible. All
      the individual data access features are usable on their own but
      integrate nicely with Spring's application context concept, providing
      XML-based configuration and cross-referencing of plain JavaBean
      instances that don't need to be Spring-aware. In a typical Spring
      application, many important objects are JavaBeans: data access
      templates, data access objects (that use the templates), transaction
      managers, business services (that use the data access objects and
      transaction managers), web view resolvers, web controllers (that use the
      business services),and so on.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="orm-session-factory-setup">
      <title><interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename> setup in a Spring
      container</title>

      <para>To avoid tying application objects to hard-coded resource lookups,
      Spring allows you to define resources such as a JDBC
      <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename> or a Hibernate
      <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename> as beans in the Spring
      container. Application objects that need to access resources just
      receive references to such pre-defined instances via bean references
      (the DAO definition in the next section illustrates this). The following
      excerpt from an XML application context definition shows how to set up a
      JDBC <classname>DataSource</classname> and a Hibernate
      <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename> on top of it:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;beans&gt;

  &lt;bean id="myDataSource" class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource" destroy-method="close"&gt;
    &lt;property name="driverClassName" value="org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="url" value="jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost:9001"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="username" value="sa"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="password" value=""/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

  &lt;bean id="mySessionFactory" class="org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.LocalSessionFactoryBean"&gt;
    &lt;property name="dataSource" ref="myDataSource"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="mappingResources"&gt;
      &lt;list&gt;
        &lt;value&gt;product.hbm.xml&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name="hibernateProperties"&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;
        hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.HSQLDialect
      &lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>Note that switching from a local Jakarta Commons DBCP
      <classname>BasicDataSource</classname> to a JNDI-located
      <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename> (usually managed by an
      application server) is just a matter of configuration:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;beans&gt;

  &lt;bean id="myDataSource" class="org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean"&gt;
    &lt;property name="jndiName" value="java:comp/env/jdbc/myds"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>You can also access a JNDI-located
      <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename>, using Spring's
      <classname>JndiObjectFactoryBean</classname> to retrieve and expose it.
      However, that is typically not common outside of an EJB context.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="orm-hibernate-template">
      <title>The <classname>HibernateTemplate</classname></title>

      <para>The basic programming model for templating looks as follows, for
      methods that can be part of any custom data access object or business
      service. There are no restrictions on the implementation of the
      surrounding object at all, it just needs to provide a Hibernate
      <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename>. It can get the latter
      from anywhere, but preferably as bean reference from a Spring IoC
      container - via a simple <methodname>setSessionFactory(..)</methodname>
      bean property setter. The following snippets show a DAO definition in a
      Spring container, referencing the above defined
      <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename>, and an example for a DAO
      method implementation.</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;beans&gt;

  &lt;bean id="myProductDao" class="product.ProductDaoImpl"&gt;
    &lt;property name="sessionFactory" ref="mySessionFactory"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>

      <programlisting language="java">public class ProductDaoImpl implements ProductDao {

    private HibernateTemplate hibernateTemplate;

    public void setSessionFactory(SessionFactory sessionFactory) {
        this.hibernateTemplate = new HibernateTemplate(sessionFactory);
    }

    public Collection loadProductsByCategory(String category) throws DataAccessException {
    	return this.hibernateTemplate.find("from test.Product product where product.category=?", category);
    }
}</programlisting>

      <para>The <classname>HibernateTemplate</classname> class provides many
      methods that mirror the methods exposed on the Hibernate
      <interfacename>Session</interfacename> interface, in addition to a
      number of convenience methods such as the one shown above. If you need
      access to the <interfacename>Session</interfacename> to invoke methods
      that are not exposed on the <classname>HibernateTemplate</classname>,
      you can always drop down to a callback-based approach like so.</para>

      <programlisting language="java">public class ProductDaoImpl implements ProductDao {

    private HibernateTemplate hibernateTemplate;

    public void setSessionFactory(SessionFactory sessionFactory) {
        this.hibernateTemplate = new HibernateTemplate(sessionFactory);
    }

    public Collection loadProductsByCategory(final String category) throws DataAccessException {
        return this.hibernateTemplate.execute(new HibernateCallback() {

            public Object doInHibernate(Session session) {
                Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Product.class);
                criteria.add(Expression.eq("category", category));
                criteria.setMaxResults(6);
                return criteria.list();
            }
        };
    }
}</programlisting>

      <para>A callback implementation effectively can be used for any
      Hibernate data access. <classname>HibernateTemplate</classname> will
      ensure that <interfacename>Session</interfacename> instances are
      properly opened and closed, and automatically participate in
      transactions. The template instances are thread-safe and reusable, they
      can thus be kept as instance variables of the surrounding class. For
      simple single step actions like a single find, load, saveOrUpdate, or
      delete call, <classname>HibernateTemplate</classname> offers alternative
      convenience methods that can replace such one line callback
      implementations. Furthermore, Spring provides a convenient
      <classname>HibernateDaoSupport</classname> base class that provides a
      <methodname>setSessionFactory(..)</methodname> method for receiving a
      <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename>, and
      <methodname>getSessionFactory()</methodname> and
      <methodname>getHibernateTemplate()</methodname>for use by subclasses. In
      combination, this allows for very simple DAO implementations for typical
      requirements:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">public class ProductDaoImpl extends HibernateDaoSupport implements ProductDao {

    public Collection loadProductsByCategory(String category) throws DataAccessException {
        return this.getHibernateTemplate().find(
            "from test.Product product where product.category=?", category);
    }
}</programlisting>
    </section>

    <section id="orm-hibernate-daos">
      <title>Implementing Spring-based DAOs without callbacks</title>

      <para>As alternative to using Spring's
      <classname>HibernateTemplate</classname> to implement DAOs, data access
      code can also be written in a more traditional fashion, without wrapping
      the Hibernate access code in a callback, while still respecting and
      participating in Spring's generic
      <classname>DataAccessException</classname> hierarchy. The
      <classname>HibernateDaoSupport</classname> base class offers methods to
      access the current transactional <interfacename>Session</interfacename>
      and to convert exceptions in such a scenario; similar methods are also
      available as static helpers on the
      <classname>SessionFactoryUtils</classname> class. Note that such code
      will usually pass '<literal>false</literal>' as the value of the
      <methodname>getSession(..)</methodname> methods
      '<literal>allowCreate</literal>' argument, to enforce running within a
      transaction (which avoids the need to close the returned
      <interfacename>Session</interfacename>, as its lifecycle is managed by
      the transaction).</para>

      <programlisting language="java">public class HibernateProductDao extends HibernateDaoSupport implements ProductDao {

    public Collection loadProductsByCategory(String category) throws DataAccessException, MyException {
        Session session = getSession(false);
        try {
            Query query = session.createQuery("from test.Product product where product.category=?");
            query.setString(0, category);
            List result = query.list();
            if (result == null) {
                throw new MyException("No search results.");
            }
            return result;
        }
        catch (HibernateException ex) {
            throw convertHibernateAccessException(ex);
        }
    }
}</programlisting>

      <para>The advantage of such direct Hibernate access code is that it
      allows <emphasis>any</emphasis> checked application exception to be
      thrown within the data access code; contrast this to the
      <classname>HibernateTemplate</classname> class which is restricted to
      throwing only unchecked exceptions within the callback. Note that you
      can often defer the corresponding checks and the throwing of application
      exceptions to after the callback, which still allows working with
      <classname>HibernateTemplate</classname>. In general, the
      <classname>HibernateTemplate</classname> class' convenience methods are
      simpler and more convenient for many scenarios.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="orm-hibernate-straight">
      <title>Implementing DAOs based on plain Hibernate 3 API</title>

      <para>Hibernate 3 provides a feature called "contextual Sessions", where
      Hibernate itself manages one current
      <interfacename>Session</interfacename> per transaction. This is roughly
      equivalent to Spring's synchronization of one Hibernate
      <interfacename>Session</interfacename> per transaction. A corresponding
      DAO implementation looks like as follows, based on the plain Hibernate
      API:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">public class ProductDaoImpl implements ProductDao {

    private SessionFactory sessionFactory;

    public void setSessionFactory(SessionFactory sessionFactory) {
        this.sessionFactory = sessionFactory;
    }

    public Collection loadProductsByCategory(String category) {
        return this.sessionFactory.getCurrentSession()
                .createQuery("from test.Product product where product.category=?")
                .setParameter(0, category)
                .list();
    }
}</programlisting>

      <para>This style is very similar to what you will find in the Hibernate
      reference documentation and examples, except for holding the
      <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename> in an instance variable.
      We strongly recommend such an instance-based setup over the old-school
      <literal>static</literal> <classname>HibernateUtil</classname> class
      from Hibernate's CaveatEmptor sample application. (In general, do not
      keep any resources in <literal>static</literal> variables unless
      <emphasis>absolutely</emphasis> necessary.)</para>

      <para>The above DAO follows the Dependency Injection pattern: it fits
      nicely into a Spring IoC container, just like it would if coded against
      Spring's <classname>HibernateTemplate</classname>. Of course, such a DAO
      can also be set up in plain Java (for example, in unit tests): simply
      instantiate it and call <methodname>setSessionFactory(..)</methodname>
      with the desired factory reference. As a Spring bean definition, it
      would look as follows:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;beans&gt;

  &lt;bean id="myProductDao" class="product.ProductDaoImpl"&gt;
    &lt;property name="sessionFactory" ref="mySessionFactory"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>The main advantage of this DAO style is that it depends on
      Hibernate API only; no import of any Spring class is required. This is
      of course appealing from a non-invasiveness perspective, and will no
      doubt feel more natural to Hibernate developers.</para>

      <para>However, the DAO throws plain
      <classname>HibernateException</classname> (which is unchecked, so does
      not have to be declared or caught), which means that callers can only
      treat exceptions as generally fatal - unless they want to depend on
      Hibernate's own exception hierarchy. Catching specific causes such as an
      optimistic locking failure is not possible without tieing the caller to
      the implementation strategy. This tradeoff might be acceptable to
      applications that are strongly Hibernate-based and/or do not need any
      special exception treatment.</para>

      <para>Fortunately, Spring's
      <classname>LocalSessionFactoryBean</classname> supports Hibernate's
      <methodname>SessionFactory.getCurrentSession()</methodname> method for
      any Spring transaction strategy, returning the current Spring-managed
      transactional <interfacename>Session</interfacename> even with
      <classname>HibernateTransactionManager</classname>. Of course, the
      standard behavior of that method remains: returning the current
      <interfacename>Session</interfacename> associated with the ongoing JTA
      transaction, if any (no matter whether driven by Spring's
      <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname>, by EJB CMT, or by
      JTA).</para>

      <para>In summary: DAOs can be implemented based on the plain Hibernate 3
      API, while still being able to participate in Spring-managed
      transactions.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="orm-hibernate-tx-programmatic">
      <title>Programmatic transaction demarcation</title>

      <para>Transactions can be demarcated in a higher level of the
      application, on top of such lower-level data access services spanning
      any number of operations. There are no restrictions on the
      implementation of the surrounding business service here as well, it just
      needs a Spring <classname>PlatformTransactionManager</classname>. Again,
      the latter can come from anywhere, but preferably as bean reference via
      a <methodname>setTransactionManager(..)</methodname> method - just like
      the <classname>productDAO</classname> should be set via a
      <methodname>setProductDao(..)</methodname> method. The following
      snippets show a transaction manager and a business service definition in
      a Spring application context, and an example for a business method
      implementation.</para>

      <para>Alternatively, one can use Spring's declarative transaction
      support, which essentially enables you to replace explicit transaction
      demarcation API calls in your Java code with an AOP transaction
      interceptor configured in a Spring container. This allows you to keep
      business services free of repetitive transaction demarcation code, and
      allows you to focus on adding business logic which is where the real
      value of your application lies. Furthermore, transaction semantics like
      propagation behavior and isolation level can be changed in a

      <para>Both <classname>TransactionTemplate</classname> and
      <classname>TransactionInterceptor</classname> delegate the actual
      transaction handling to a
      <classname>PlatformTransactionManager</classname> instance, which can be
      a <classname>HibernateTransactionManager</classname> (for a single
      Hibernate <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename>, using a
      <classname>ThreadLocal</classname>
      <interfacename>Session</interfacename> under the hood) or a
      <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname> (delegating to the JTA
      subsystem of the container) for Hibernate applications. You could even
      use a custom <classname>PlatformTransactionManager</classname>
      implementation. So switching from native Hibernate transaction
      management to JTA, such as when facing distributed transaction
      requirements for certain deployments of your application, is just a
      matter of configuration. Simply replace the Hibernate transaction
      manager with Spring's JTA transaction implementation. Both transaction
      demarcation and data access code will work without changes, as they just
      use the generic transaction management APIs.</para>

      <para>For distributed transactions across multiple Hibernate session
      factories, simply combine <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname>
      as a transaction strategy with multiple
      <classname>LocalSessionFactoryBean</classname> definitions. Each of your
      DAOs then gets one specific
      <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename> reference passed into its
      corresponding bean property. If all underlying JDBC data sources are
      transactional container ones, a business service can demarcate
      transactions across any number of DAOs and any number of session
      factories without special regard, as long as it is using
      <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname> as the strategy.</para>

      <title>Container resources versus local resources</title>

      <para>Spring's resource management allows for simple switching between a
      JNDI <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename> and a local one,
      without having to change a single line of application code. The decision
      as to whether to keep the resource definitions in the container or
      locally within the application, is mainly a matter of the transaction
      strategy being used. Compared to a Spring-defined local
      <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename>, a manually registered
      JNDI <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename> does not provide any
      benefits. Deploying a <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename>
      through Hibernate's JCA connector provides the added value of
      participating in the J2EE server's management infrastructure, but does
      not add actual value beyond that.</para>

      <para>An important benefit of Spring's transaction support is that it
      isn't bound to a container at all. Configured to any other strategy than
      JTA, it will work in a standalone or test environment too. Especially
      for the typical case of single-database transactions, this is a very
      lightweight and powerful alternative to JTA. When using local EJB
      Stateless Session Beans to drive transactions, you depend both on an EJB
      container and JTA - even if you just access a single database anyway,
      and just use SLSBs for declarative transactions via CMT. The alternative
      of using JTA programmatically requires a J2EE environment as well. JTA
      does not just involve container dependencies in terms of JTA itself and
      of JNDI <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename> instances. For
      non-Spring JTA-driven Hibernate transactions, you have to use the
      Hibernate JCA connector, or extra Hibernate transaction code with the
      <interfacename>TransactionManagerLookup</interfacename> being configured
      for proper JVM-level caching.</para>

      <para>Spring-driven transactions can work with a locally defined
      Hibernate <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename> nicely, just
      like with a local JDBC <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename> - if
      accessing a single database, of course. Therefore you just have to fall
      back to Spring's JTA transaction strategy when actually facing
      distributed transaction requirements. Note that a JCA connector needs
      container-specific deployment steps, and obviously JCA support in the
      first place. This is far more hassle than deploying a simple web app
      with local resource definitions and Spring-driven transactions. And you
      often need the Enterprise Edition of your container, as for example
      WebLogic Express does not provide JCA. A Spring application with local
      resources and transactions spanning one single database will work in any
      J2EE web container (without JTA, JCA, or EJB) - like Tomcat, Resin, or
      even plain Jetty. Additionally, such a middle tier can be reused in
      desktop applications or test suites easily.</para>

      <para>All things considered: if you do not use EJB, stick with local
      <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename> setup and Spring's
      <classname>HibernateTransactionManager</classname> or
      <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname>. You will get all of the
      benefits including proper transactional JVM-level caching and
      distributed transactions, without any container deployment hassle. JNDI
      registration of a Hibernate
      <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename> via the JCA connector
      really only adds value when used in conjunction with EJBs.</para>

      <title>Spurious application server warnings when using Hibernate</title>

      <para>In some JTA environments with very strict
      <interfacename>XADataSource</interfacename> implementations -- currently
      only some WebLogic and WebSphere versions -- when using Hibernate
      configured without any awareness of the JTA
      <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename> object for
      that environment, it is possible for spurious warning or exceptions to
      show up in the application server log. These warnings or exceptions will
      say something to the effect that the connection being accessed is no
      longer valid, or JDBC access is no longer valid, possibly because the
      transaction is no longer active. As an example, here is an actual
      exception from WebLogic:</para>

      <programlisting>java.sql.SQLException: The transaction is no longer active - status: 'Committed'.
   No further JDBC access is allowed within this transaction.</programlisting>

      <para>This warning is easy to resolve by simply making Hibernate aware
      of the JTA <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename>
      instance, to which it will also synchronize (along with Spring). This
      may be done in two ways:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>If in your application context you are already directly

          and feeding it for example to Spring's
          <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname>, then the easiest way
          is to simply specify a reference to this as the value of
          <classname>LocalSessionFactoryBean</classname>'s
          <emphasis>jtaTransactionManager</emphasis> property. Spring will

      <title>Implementing DAOs based on the plain JDO API</title>

      <para>DAOs can also be written against plain JDO API, without any Spring
      dependencies, directly using an injected
      <interfacename>PersistenceManagerFactory</interfacename>. A
      corresponding DAO implementation looks like as follows:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">public class ProductDaoImpl implements ProductDao {

    private PersistenceManagerFactory persistenceManagerFactory;

    public void setPersistenceManagerFactory(PersistenceManagerFactory pmf) {
        this.persistenceManagerFactory = pmf;
    }

    public Collection loadProductsByCategory(String category) {
        PersistenceManager pm = this.persistenceManagerFactory.getPersistenceManager();
        try {
            Query query = pm.newQuery(Product.class, "category = pCategory");
            query.declareParameters("String pCategory"); 
            return query.execute(category);
        }
        finally {
          pm.close();
        }
    }
}</programlisting>

      <para>As the above DAO still follows the Dependency Injection pattern,
      it still fits nicely into a Spring container, just like it would if
      coded against Spring's <classname>JdoTemplate</classname>:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;beans&gt;

  &lt;bean id="myProductDao" class="product.ProductDaoImpl"&gt;
    &lt;property name="persistenceManagerFactory" ref="myPmf"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>The main issue with such DAOs is that they always get a new
      <interfacename>PersistenceManager</interfacename> from the factory. To
      still access a Spring-managed transactional
      <interfacename>PersistenceManager</interfacename>, consider defining a
      <classname>TransactionAwarePersistenceManagerFactoryProxy</classname>
      (as included in Spring) in front of your target
      <interfacename>PersistenceManagerFactory</interfacename>, passing the
      proxy into your DAOs.</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;beans&gt;

  &lt;bean id="myPmfProxy"
      class="org.springframework.orm.jdo.TransactionAwarePersistenceManagerFactoryProxy"&gt;
    &lt;property name="targetPersistenceManagerFactory" ref="myPmf"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

  &lt;bean id="myProductDao" class="product.ProductDaoImpl"&gt;
    &lt;property name="persistenceManagerFactory" ref="myPmfProxy"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>Your data access code will then receive a transactional
      <interfacename>PersistenceManager</interfacename> (if any) from the
      <methodname>PersistenceManagerFactory.getPersistenceManager()</methodname>
      method that it calls. The latter method call goes through the proxy,
      which will first check for a current transactional
      <interfacename>PersistenceManager</interfacename> before getting a new
      one from the factory. <methodname>close()</methodname> calls on the
      <interfacename>PersistenceManager</interfacename> will be ignored in
      case of a transactional
      <interfacename>PersistenceManager</interfacename>.</para>

      <para>If your data access code will always run within an active
      transaction (or at least within active transaction synchronization), it
      is safe to omit the <methodname>PersistenceManager.close()</methodname>
      call and thus the entire <literal>finally</literal> block, which you
      might prefer to keep your DAO implementations concise:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">public class ProductDaoImpl implements ProductDao {

    private PersistenceManagerFactory persistenceManagerFactory;

    public void setPersistenceManagerFactory(PersistenceManagerFactory pmf) {
        this.persistenceManagerFactory = pmf;
    }

    public Collection loadProductsByCategory(String category) {
        PersistenceManager pm = this.persistenceManagerFactory.getPersistenceManager();
        Query query = pm.newQuery(Product.class, "category = pCategory");
        query.declareParameters("String pCategory"); 
        return query.execute(category);
    }
}</programlisting>

      <para>With such DAOs that rely on active transactions, it is recommended
      to enforce active transactions through turning
      <classname>TransactionAwarePersistenceManagerFactoryProxy</classname>'s
      "allowCreate" flag off:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;beans&gt;

  &lt;bean id="myPmfProxy"
      class="org.springframework.orm.jdo.TransactionAwarePersistenceManagerFactoryProxy"&gt;
    &lt;property name="targetPersistenceManagerFactory" ref="myPmf"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="allowCreate" value="false"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

  &lt;bean id="myProductDao" class="product.ProductDaoImpl"&gt;
    &lt;property name="persistenceManagerFactory" ref="myPmfProxy"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>The main advantage of this DAO style is that it depends on JDO API
      only; no import of any Spring class is required. This is of course
      appealing from a non-invasiveness perspective, and might feel more
      natural to JDO developers.</para>

      <para>However, the DAO throws plain
      <exceptionname>JDOException</exceptionname> (which is unchecked, so does
      not have to be declared or caught), which means that callers can only
      treat exceptions as generally fatal - unless they want to depend on
      JDO's own exception structure. Catching specific causes such as an
      optimistic locking failure is not possible without tying the caller to
      the implementation strategy. This tradeoff might be acceptable to
      applications that are strongly JDO-based and/or do not need any special
      exception treatment.</para>

      <para>In summary: DAOs can be implemented based on plain JDO API, while
      still being able to participate in Spring-managed transactions. This
      might in particular appeal to people already familiar with JDO, feeling
      more natural to them. However, such DAOs will throw plain
      <exceptionname>JDOException</exceptionname>; conversion to Spring's
      <exceptionname>DataAccessException</exceptionname> would have to happen
      explicitly (if desired).</para>

      <para>Note that JDO requires an active transaction when modifying a
      persistent object. There is no concept like a non-transactional flush in
      JDO, in contrast to Hibernate. For this reason, the chosen JDO
      implementation needs to be set up for a specific environment: in
      particular, it needs to be explicitly set up for JTA synchronization, to
      detect an active JTA transaction itself. This is not necessary for local
      transactions as performed by Spring's
      <classname>JdoTransactionManager</classname>, but it is necessary for
      participating in JTA transactions (whether driven by Spring's
      <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname> or by EJB CMT / plain

      <title>Implementing DAOs based on plain TopLink API</title>

      <para>DAOs can also be written against plain TopLink API, without any
      Spring dependencies, directly using an injected TopLink
      <interfacename>Session</interfacename>. The latter will usually be based
      on a <interfacename>SessionFactory</interfacename> defined by a
      <classname>LocalSessionFactoryBean</classname>, exposed for bean
      references of type <interfacename>Session</interfacename> through
      Spring's <literal>TransactionAwareSessionAdapter</literal>.</para>

      <para>The <literal>getActiveSession()</literal> method defined on
      TopLink's <interfacename>Session</interfacename> interface will return
      the current transactional <interfacename>Session</interfacename> in such
      a scenario. If there is no active transaction, it will return the shared
      TopLink <literal>ServerSession</literal> as-is, which is only supposed
      to be used directly for read-only access. There is also an analogous
      <methodname>getActiveUnitOfWork()</methodname> method, returning the
      TopLink <interfacename>UnitOfWork</interfacename> associated with the
      current transaction, if any (returning <literal>null</literal>
      else).</para>

      <para>A corresponding DAO implementation looks like as follows:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">public class ProductDaoImpl implements ProductDao {

    private Session session;

    public void setSession(Session session) {
        this.session = session;
    }

    public Collection loadProductsByCategory(String category) {
        ReadAllQuery findOwnersQuery = new ReadAllQuery(Product.class);
        findOwnersQuery.addArgument("Category");
        ExpressionBuilder builder = this.findOwnersQuery.getExpressionBuilder();
        findOwnersQuery.setSelectionCriteria(
            builder.get("category").like(builder.getParameter("Category")));

        Vector args = new Vector();
        args.add(category);
        return session.getActiveSession().executeQuery(findOwnersQuery, args);
    }
}</programlisting>

      <para>As the above DAO still follows the Dependency Injection pattern,
      it still fits nicely into a Spring application context, analogous to
      like it would if coded against Spring's
      <classname>TopLinkTemplate</classname>. Spring's
      <literal>TransactionAwareSessionAdapter</literal> is used to expose a
      bean reference of type <interfacename>Session</interfacename>, to be
      passed into the DAO:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;beans&gt;

  &lt;bean id="mySessionAdapter"
      class="org.springframework.orm.toplink.support.TransactionAwareSessionAdapter"&gt;
    &lt;property name="sessionFactory" ref="mySessionFactory"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

  &lt;bean id="myProductDao" class="product.ProductDaoImpl"&gt;
    &lt;property name="session" ref="mySessionAdapter"/&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>The main advantage of this DAO style is that it depends on TopLink
      API only; no import of any Spring class is required. This is of course
      appealing from a non-invasiveness perspective, and might feel more
      natural to TopLink developers.</para>

      <para>However, the DAO throws plain
      <exceptionname>TopLinkException</exceptionname> (which is unchecked, so
      does not have to be declared or caught), which means that callers can
      only treat exceptions as generally fatal - unless they want to depend on
      TopLink's own exception structure. Catching specific causes such as an
      optimistic locking failure is not possible without tying the caller to
      the implementation strategy. This tradeoff might be acceptable to
      applications that are strongly TopLink-based and/or do not need any
      special exception treatment.</para>

      <para>A further disadvantage of that DAO style is that TopLink's
      standard <methodname>getActiveSession()</methodname> feature just works
      within JTA transactions. It does <emphasis>not</emphasis> work with any
      other transaction strategy out-of-the-box, in particular not with local
      TopLink transactions.</para>

      <para>Fortunately, Spring's
      <literal>TransactionAwareSessionAdapter</literal> exposes a
      corresponding proxy for the TopLink <literal>ServerSession</literal>
      which supports TopLink's <literal>Session.getActiveSession()</literal>
      and <literal>Session.getActiveUnitOfWork()</literal> methods for any
      Spring transaction strategy, returning the current Spring-managed
      transactional <interfacename>Session</interfacename> even with
      <literal>TopLinkTransactionManager</literal>. Of course, the standard
      behavior of that method remains: returning the current
      <interfacename>Session</interfacename> associated with the ongoing JTA
      transaction, if any (no matter whether driven by Spring's
      <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname>, by EJB CMT, or by plain
      JTA).</para>

      <para>In summary: DAOs can be implemented based on plain TopLink API,
      while still being able to participate in Spring-managed transactions.
      This might in particular appeal to people already familiar with TopLink,
      feeling more natural to them. However, such DAOs will throw plain
      <exceptionname>TopLinkException</exceptionname>; conversion to Spring's
      <classname>DataAccessException</classname> would have to happen
      explicitly (if desired).</para>

      <title>Transaction management</title>

      <para>To execute service operations within transactions, you can use
      Spring's common declarative transaction facilities. For example:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

      &lt;tx:method name="*" propagation="SUPPORTS" read-only="true"/&gt;
    &lt;/tx:attributes&gt;
  &lt;/tx:advice&gt;

&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>Note that TopLink requires an active
      <interfacename>UnitOfWork</interfacename> for modifying a persistent
      object. (You should never modify objects returned by a plain TopLink
      <interfacename>Session</interfacename> - those are usually read-only
      objects, directly taken from the second-level cache!) There is no
      concept like a non-transactional flush in TopLink, in contrast to
      Hibernate. For this reason, TopLink needs to be set up for a specific
      environment: in particular, it needs to be explicitly set up for JTA
      synchronization, to detect an active JTA transaction itself and expose a
      corresponding active <interfacename>Session</interfacename> and
      <interfacename>UnitOfWork</interfacename>. This is not necessary for
      local transactions as performed by Spring's
      <literal>TopLinkTransactionManager</literal>, but it is necessary for
      participating in JTA transactions (whether driven by Spring's
      <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname> or by EJB CMT / plain
      JTA).</para>

      <para>Within your TopLink-based DAO code, use the
      <literal>Session.getActiveUnitOfWork()</literal> method to access the
      current <interfacename>UnitOfWork</interfacename> and perform write
      operations through it. This will only work within an active transaction
      (both within Spring-managed transactions and plain JTA transactions).
      For special needs, you can also acquire separate
      <interfacename>UnitOfWork</interfacename> instances that won't
      participate in the current transaction; this is hardly needed,
      though.</para>

      <para><classname>TopLinkTransactionManager</classname> is capable of
      exposing a TopLink transaction to JDBC access code that accesses the
      same JDBC <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename>, provided that
      TopLink works with JDBC in the backend and is thus able to expose the
      underlying JDBC <interfacename>Connection</interfacename>. The
      <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename> to expose the transactions for
      needs to be specified explicitly; it won't be autodetected.</para>

    <title>iBATIS SQL Maps</title>

    <para>The iBATIS support in the Spring Framework much resembles the JDBC /

    exception hierarchy and let's you enjoy the all IoC features Spring

    <para>Transaction management can be handled through Spring's standard

      <para>Note that a <classname>SqlMapTemplate</classname> instance could

      base class simply pre-initializes a

      <para>The <classname>SqlMapClientTemplate</classname> also offers a

      <para>In general, any combination of operations offered by the native

        to happen, in order to support the
        <literal>&lt;exclude-unlisted-classes/&gt;</literal> shortcut.
        This is in line with the JPA specification (which suggests that shortcut)
        but unfortunately in conflict with the JPA XSD (which implies "false"
        for that shortcut). As a consequence,
        "<literal>&lt;exclude-unlisted-classes&gt; false &lt;/exclude-unlisted-classes/&gt;</literal>"
        is not supported! Simply omit the "exclude-unlisted-classes" element if
        you would like entity class scanning to actually happen.</emphasis></para>

        <para>This is the most powerful JPA setup option, allowing for
        flexible local configuration within the application. It supports links
        to an existing JDBC <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename>,
        supports both local and global transactions, etc. However, it also
        imposes requirements onto the runtime environment, such as the
        availability of a weaving-capable ClassLoader if the persistence
        provider demands byte-code transformation.</para>

        <para>Note that this option may conflict with the built-in JPA
        capabilities of a Java EE 5 server. So when running in a full Java EE
        5 environment, consider obtaining your
        <interfacename>EntityManagerFactory</interfacename> from JNDI.
        Alternatively, specify a custom "persistenceXmlLocation" on your
        <classname>LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean</classname>
        definition, e.g. "META-INF/my-persistence.xml", and only include a
        descriptor with that name in your application jar files. Since the
        Java EE 5 server will only look for default
        <literal>META-INF/persistence.xml</literal> files, it will ignore such
        custom persistence units and hence avoid conflicts with a
        Spring-driven JPA setup upfront. (This applies to Resin 3.1, for
        example.)</para>

        <para><emphasis>Use this option for full JPA capabilities in a
        Spring-based application environment. This includes web containers
        such as Tomcat as well as standalone applications and integration
        tests with sophisticated persistence requirements.</emphasis></para>

          the load-time weaver <emphasis role="bold">should not</emphasis> be

      <para>The DAO above has no dependency on Spring and still fits nicely
      into a Spring application context, just like it would if coded against
      Spring's <classname>JpaTemplate</classname>. Moreover, the DAO takes
      advantage of annotations to require the injection of the default
      <interfacename>EntityManagerFactory</interfacename>:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;beans&gt;

  <lineannotation>&lt;!-- bean post-processor for JPA annotations --&gt;</lineannotation>
  &lt;bean class="org.springframework.orm.jpa.support.PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor"/&gt;

  &lt;bean id="myProductDao" class="product.ProductDaoImpl"/&gt;

&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>Note: As alternative to defining a
      <classname>PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor</classname>
      explicitly, consider using Spring 2.5's
      <literal>context:annotation-config</literal> XML element in your
      application context configuration. This will automatically register all
      of Spring's standard post-processors for annotation-based configuration
      (including <classname>CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor</classname>
      etc).</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;beans&gt;

  <lineannotation>&lt;!-- post-processors for all standard config annotations --&gt;</lineannotation>
  &lt;context:annotation-config/&gt;

  &lt;bean id="myProductDao" class="product.ProductDaoImpl"/&gt;

&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>The main issue with such a DAO is that it always creates a new
      <interfacename>EntityManager</interfacename> via the factory. This can
      be easily overcome by requesting a transactional
      <interfacename>EntityManager</interfacename> (also called "shared
      EntityManager", since it is a shared, thread-safe proxy for the actual
      transactional EntityManager) to be injected instead of the
      factory:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">public class ProductDaoImpl implements ProductDao {

    @PersistenceContext
    private EntityManager em;

    public Collection loadProductsByCategory(String category) {
       Query query = em.createQuery("from Product as p where p.category = :category");
       query.setParameter("category", category);
       return query.getResultList(); 
    }
}</programlisting>

      <para>Note that the <literal>@PersistenceContext</literal> annotation
      has an optional attribute <literal>type</literal>, which defaults to
      <literal>PersistenceContextType.TRANSACTION</literal>. This default is
      what you need to receive a "shared EntityManager" proxy. The
      alternative, <literal>PersistenceContextType.EXTENDED</literal>, is a
      completely different affair: This results in a so-called "extended
      EntityManager", which is <emphasis>not thread-safe</emphasis> and hence
      must not be used in a concurrently accessed component such as a
      Spring-managed singleton bean. Extended EntityManagers are only supposed
      to be used in stateful components that, for example, reside in a
      session, with the lifecycle of the EntityManager not tied to a current
      transaction but rather being completely up to the application.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Method and Field level Injection</title>

        <para>Annotations that indicate dependency injections (such as
        <literal>@PersistenceUnit</literal> and
        <literal>@PersistenceContext</literal>) can be applied on field or
        methods inside a class, therefore the expression "method/field level
        injection". Field-level annotations concise and easier to use while
        method-level allow for processing the injected dependency. In both
        cases the member visibility (public, protected, private) does not
        matter.</para>

        <para>What about class level annotations?</para>

        <para>On the Java EE 5 platform, they are used for dependency declaration
        and not for resource injection.</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>The injected <interfacename>EntityManager</interfacename> is
      Spring-managed (aware of the ongoing transaction). It is important to
      note that even though the new implementation prefers method level
      injection (of an <interfacename>EntityManager</interfacename> instead of
      an <interfacename>EntityManagerFactory)</interfacename>, no change is
      required in the application context XML due to annotation usage.</para>

      <para>The main advantage of this DAO style is that it depends on Java
      Persistence API; no import of any Spring class is required. Moreover, as
      the JPA annotations are understood, the injections are applied
      automatically by the Spring container. This is of course appealing from
      a non-invasiveness perspective, and might feel more natural to JPA
      developers.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="orm-jpa-exceptions">
      <title>Exception Translation</title>

      <para>However, the DAO throws the plain
      <classname>PersistenceException</classname> exception class (which is
      unchecked, and so does not have to be declared or caught) but also
      <classname>IllegalArgumentException</classname> and
      <classname>IllegalStateException</classname>, which means that callers
      can only treat exceptions as generally fatal - unless they want to
      depend on JPA's own exception structure. Catching specific causes such
      as an optimistic locking failure is not possible without tying the
      caller to the implementation strategy. This tradeoff might be acceptable
      to applications that are strongly JPA-based and/or do not need any
      special exception treatment. However, Spring offers a solution allowing
      exception translation to be applied transparently through the
      <interfacename>@Repository</interfacename> annotation:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">@Repository
public class ProductDaoImpl implements ProductDao {

    <lineannotation>// class body here...</lineannotation>

}</programlisting>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;beans&gt;

  <lineannotation>&lt;!-- <classname>Exception</classname> translation bean post processor --&gt;</lineannotation>
  &lt;bean class="org.springframework.dao.annotation.PersistenceExceptionTranslationPostProcessor"/&gt;

  &lt;bean id="myProductDao" class="product.ProductDaoImpl"/&gt;

&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>The postprocessor will automatically look for all exception
      translators (implementations of the
      <interfacename>PersistenceExceptionTranslator</interfacename> interface)
      and advise all beans marked with the
      <interfacename>@Repository</interfacename> annotation so that the
      discovered translators can intercept and apply the appropriate
      translation on the thrown exceptions.</para>

      <para>In summary: DAOs can be implemented based on the plain Java
      Persistence API and annotations, while still being able to benefit from
      Spring-managed transactions, dependency injection, and transparent
      exception conversion (if desired) to Spring's custom exception
      hierarchies.</para>

    <para>Spring JPA allows a configured
    <classname>JpaTransactionManager</classname> to expose a JPA transaction
    to JDBC access code that accesses the same JDBC
    <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename>, provided that the registered
    <interfacename>JpaDialect</interfacename> supports retrieval of the
    underlying JDBC <interfacename>Connection</interfacename>. Out of the box,
    Spring provides dialects for the Toplink, Hibernate and OpenJPA JPA
    implementations. See the next section for details on the

    <para>As an advanced feature <classname>JpaTemplate</classname>,
    <classname>JpaTransactionManager</classname> and subclasses of
    <classname>AbstractEntityManagerFactoryBean</classname> support a custom
    <interfacename>JpaDialect</interfacename>, to be passed into the
    "jpaDialect" bean property. In such a scenario, the DAOs won't receive an
    <interfacename>EntityManagerFactory</interfacename> reference but rather a
    full <classname>JpaTemplate</classname> instance instead (for example,
    passed into <classname>JpaDaoSupport</classname>'s "jpaTemplate"
    property). A <interfacename>JpaDialect</interfacename> implementation can
    enable some advanced features supported by Spring, usually in a
    vendor-specific manner:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>applying specific transaction semantics (such as custom

      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>retrieving the transactional JDBC

    <para>This is particularly valuable for special transaction semantics and
    for advanced translation of exception. Note that the default
    implementation used (<classname>DefaultJpaDialect</classname>) doesn't
    provide any special capabilities and if the above features are required,
    the appropriate dialect has to be specified.</para>
