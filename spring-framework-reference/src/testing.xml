    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>The Spring team considers developer testing to be an absolutely
    integral part of enterprise software development. A thorough treatment of
    testing in the enterprise is beyond the scope of this chapter; rather, the
    focus here is on the value-add that the adoption of the IoC principle can
    bring to <link linkend="unit-testing">unit testing</link> and on the
    benefits that the Spring Framework provides in <link
    linkend="integration-testing">integration testing</link>.</para>

    <title>Unit testing</title>

    <para>One of the main benefits of Dependency Injection is that your code
    should really depend far less on the container than in traditional J2EE
    development. The POJOs that make up your application should be testable
    in JUnit or TestNG tests, with objects simply instantiated using the
    <literal>new</literal> operator, <emphasis>without Spring or any other
    container</emphasis>. You can use <link linkend="mock-objects">mock
    objects</link> (in conjunction with many other valuable testing
    techniques) to test your code in isolation. If you follow the architecture
    recommendations around Spring you will find that the resulting clean
    layering and componentization of your codebase will naturally facilitate
    <emphasis>easier</emphasis> unit testing. For example, you will be able to
    test service layer objects by stubbing or mocking DAO or Repository
    interfaces, without any need to access persistent data while running unit
    tests.</para>

    <para>True unit tests typically will run extremely quickly, as there is no
    runtime infrastructure to set up, whether application server, database,
    ORM tool, or whatever. Thus emphasizing true unit tests as part of your
    development methodology will boost your productivity. The upshot of this
    is that you often do not need this section of the testing chapter to help
    you write effective <emphasis>unit</emphasis> tests for your IoC-based
    applications. For certain unit testing scenarios, however, the Spring
    Framework provides the following mock objects and testing support
    classes.</para>

        applications. If, for example, JDBC <classname>DataSource</classname>s
        get bound to the same JNDI names in test code as within a J2EE
        container, both application code and configuration can be reused in

      <title>Overview</title>

      <para>It is important to be able to perform some integration testing
      without requiring deployment to your application server or connecting to
      other enterprise infrastructure. This will enable you to test things
      such as:</para>

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The Spring Framework provides first class support for integration
      testing in the <filename class="libraryfile">org.springframework.test-VERSION.jar</filename>
      library (where <literal>VERSION</literal> is the release version). In this library,
      you will find the <literal>org.springframework.test</literal> package
      which contains valuable classes for integration testing using a Spring
      container, while at the same time not being reliant on an application
      server or other deployment environment. Such tests will be slower to run
      than unit tests but much faster to run than the equivalent Cactus tests
      or remote tests relying on deployment to an application server.</para>

	      Since Spring 2.5, unit and integration testing support is provided 
	      in the form of the annotation-driven <link
	      linkend="testcontext-framework">Spring TestContext Framework</link>.
	      The TestContext Framework is agnostic of the actual testing framework
	      in use, thus allowing
	      instrumentation of tests in various environments including JUnit 3.8,
	      JUnit 4.5, TestNG, etc.

			As of Spring 3.0, the legacy JUnit 3.8 base class hierarchy (e.g.,

          support classes</link> that are really useful when writing
          integration tests.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>In the next few sections each of the above goals is discussed
      in greater detail, and at the end of each section you will find a direct
      link to implementation and configuration details pertaining to that
      particular goal.</para>

      <section id="testing-ctx-management">
        <title>Context management and caching</title>

        <para>The Spring TestContext Framework provides consistent
        loading of Spring <classname>ApplicationContext</classname>s and
        caching of those contexts. Support for the caching of loaded contexts
        is important, because if you are working on a large project, startup
        time may become an issue - not because of the overhead of Spring
        itself, but because the objects instantiated by the Spring container
        will themselves take time to instantiate. For example, a project with
        50-100 Hibernate mapping files might take 10-20 seconds to load the
        mapping files, and incurring that cost before running every single
        test in every single test fixture will lead to slower overall test
        runs that could reduce productivity.</para>

        <para>Test classes provide an array containing the
        resource locations of XML configuration metadata - typically on the
        classpath - used to configure the application. This will be the same,
        or nearly the same, as the list of configuration locations specified
        in <literal>web.xml</literal> or other deployment
        configuration.</para>

        <para>By default, once loaded, the configured
        <interfacename>ApplicationContext</interfacename> will be reused for
        each test. Thus the setup cost will be incurred only once (per test
        fixture), and subsequent test execution will be much faster. In the
        unlikely case that a test may 'dirty' the application context,
        requiring reloading - for example, by changing a bean definition or
        the state of an application object - Spring's testing support provides
        a mechanism to cause the test fixture to reload the configurations and
        rebuild the application context before executing the next test.</para>

      <section id="testing-fixture-di">
        <title>Dependency Injection of test fixtures</title>

        <para>When the TestContext framework loads your
        application context, it can optionally configure instances of your
        test classes via Dependency Injection. This provides a convenient
        mechanism for setting up test fixtures using pre-configured beans from
        your application context. A strong benefit here is that you can reuse
        application contexts across various testing scenarios (e.g., for
        configuring Spring-managed object graphs, transactional proxies,
        <classname>DataSource</classname>s, etc.), thus avoiding the need to
        duplicate complex test fixture set up for individual test
        cases.</para>

        <para>As an example, consider the scenario where we have a class,
        <classname>HibernateTitleDao</classname>, that performs data access
        logic for say, the <classname>Title</classname> domain object. We want
        to write integration tests that test all of the following
        areas:</para>

            mapped correctly and are the correct lazy-loading settings in

      </section>

      <section id="testing-tx">
        <title>Transaction management</title>

        <para>One common issue in tests that access a real database is their
        affect on the state of the persistence store. Even when you're using a
        development database, changes to the state may affect future tests.
        Also, many operations - such as inserting or modifying persistent
        data - cannot be performed (or verified) outside a transaction.</para>

        <para>The TestContext framework addresses this issue. By default,
        the framework will create and roll back a transaction for each
        test. You simply write code that can assume the existence of a
        transaction. If you call transactionally proxied objects in your
        tests, they will behave correctly, according to their transactional
        semantics. In addition, if test methods delete the contents of
        selected tables while running within a transaction, the transaction
        will roll back by default, and the database will return to its state
        prior to execution of the test. Transactional support is provided to
        your test class via a
        <classname>PlatformTransactionManager</classname> bean defined in the
        test's application context.</para>

        <para>If you want a transaction to commit - unusual, but occasionally
        useful when you want a particular test to populate or modify the
        database - the TestContext framework can be
        instructed to cause the transaction to commit instead of roll back
        via the
        <link linkend="integration-testing-annotations"><interfacename>@TransactionConfiguration</interfacename></link>
        and 
        <link linkend="integration-testing-annotations"><interfacename>@Rollback</interfacename></link>
        annotations.</para>

        <para>The Spring TestContext Framework provides
        several <literal>abstract</literal> support classes that can simplify
        writing integration tests. These base test classes provide well
        defined hooks into the testing framework as well as convenient
        instance variables and methods, allowing access to such things

            <para>A <classname>SimpleJdbcTemplate</classname>: useful for querying to
            confirm state. For example, you might query before and after
            testing application code that creates an object and persists it
            using an ORM tool, to verify that the data appears in the
            database. (Spring will ensure that the query runs in the scope of
            the same transaction.) You will need to tell your ORM tool to
            'flush' its changes for this to work correctly, for example using
            the <methodname>flush()</methodname> method on Hibernate's

      <para>The <emphasis>Spring <classname>TestContext</classname>
      Framework</emphasis> (located in the
      <literal>org.springframework.test.context</literal> package) provides
      generic, annotation-driven unit and integration testing support that is
      agnostic of the testing framework in use, for example JUnit 3.8, JUnit
      4.5, TestNG 5.8, etc. The TestContext framework also places a great deal
      of importance on <emphasis>convention over configuration</emphasis> with
      reasonable defaults that can be overridden via annotation-based
      configuration.</para>

      <para>In addition to generic testing infrastructure, the TestContext
      framework provides explicit support for JUnit 3.8, JUnit 4.5, and TestNG
      5.8 in the form of <literal>abstract</literal> support classes. For
      JUnit 4.5, the framework also provides a custom
      <interfacename>Runner</interfacename> which allows one to write test
      classes that are not required to extend a particular class
      hierarchy.</para>

      <para>The following section provides an overview of the internals of the
      TestContext framework. If you are only interested in using the framework
      and not necessarily interested in extending it with your own custom
      listeners, feel free to go directly to the configuration (<link

        <para>Each <classname>TestContext</classname> provides context
        management and caching support for the test instance for which it is
        responsible. Test instances do not automatically receive access to the

        supplied to the test instance (provided the
        <classname>DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener</classname> has
        been configured, which is the default). Note that
        <classname>AbstractJUnit38SpringContextTests</classname>,
        <classname>AbstractJUnit4SpringContextTests</classname>, and
        <classname>AbstractTestNGSpringContextTests</classname> already

        therefore provide this functionality out-of-the-box.</para>

        <tip>
        	<title>@Autowired ApplicationContext</title>
			<para>
				As an alternative to implementing the
				<interfacename>ApplicationContextAware</interfacename> interface,
				your test class can have its application context injected via the
				<interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> annotation on either a
				field or setter method, for example:
			</para>
        <programlisting language="java">@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration
public class MyTest {
    <emphasis role="bold">@Autowired</emphasis>
    private ApplicationContext applicationContext;

    <lineannotation>// class body...</lineannotation>
}</programlisting>
        </tip>

        <para>In contrast to the now deprecated JUnit 3.8 legacy class hierarchy,
        test classes which use the TestContext framework do not need to override
        any <literal>protected</literal> instance methods to configure their
        application context. Rather, configuration is achieved merely by
        declaring the <interfacename>@ContextConfiguration</interfacename>
        annotation at the class level. If your test class does not explicitly
        declare any application context resource <literal>locations</literal>,
        the configured <interfacename>ContextLoader</interfacename> will
        determine how and whether or not to load a context from a default set
        of locations. For example,
        <classname>GenericXmlContextLoader</classname> - which is the default
        <interfacename>ContextLoader</interfacename> - will generate a default
        location based on the name of the test class. If your class is named
        <literal>com.example.MyTest</literal>,
        <classname>GenericXmlContextLoader</classname> will load your
        application context from
        <literal>"classpath:/com/example/MyTest-context.xml"</literal>.</para>

        <programlisting language="java">package com.example;

@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
<lineannotation>// ApplicationContext will be loaded from <literal>"classpath:/com/example/MyTest-context.xml"</literal></lineannotation>
<emphasis role="bold">@ContextConfiguration</emphasis>
public class MyTest {
    <lineannotation>// class body...</lineannotation>
}</programlisting>

        <para>If the default location does not suit your needs, you are free
        to explicitly configure the <literal>locations</literal> attribute of
        <interfacename>@ContextConfiguration</interfacename> (see code listing
        below) with an array containing the resource locations of XML
        configuration metadata (assuming an XML-capable
        <interfacename>ContextLoader</interfacename> has been configured) -
        typically on the classpath - used to configure the application. This
        will be the same, or nearly the same, as the list of configuration
        locations specified in <literal>web.xml</literal> or other deployment
        configuration. As an alternative you may choose to implement and
        configure your own custom
        <interfacename>ContextLoader</interfacename>.</para>

public class MyTest {
    <lineannotation>// class body...</lineannotation>
}</programlisting>

        <para><interfacename>@ContextConfiguration</interfacename> supports
        an alias for the <literal>locations</literal> attribute via the
        standard <literal>value</literal> attribute. Thus, if you do not need
        to configure a custom <interfacename>ContextLoader</interfacename>, you
        can omit the declaration of the <literal>locations</literal> attribute
        name and declare the resource locations using the shorthand format 
        demonstrated in the following example.
        <interfacename>@ContextConfiguration</interfacename> also
        supports a boolean <literal>inheritLocations</literal> attribute which

        <title>Dependency Injection of test fixtures</title>

        <para>When you configure the
        <classname>DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener</classname> -
        which is configured by default - via the
        <interfacename>@TestExecutionListeners</interfacename> annotation, the
        dependencies of your test instances will be
        <emphasis>injected</emphasis> from beans in the application context
        you configured via
        <interfacename>@ContextConfiguration</interfacename> by Setter
        Injection, Field Injection, or both, depending on which annotations
        you choose and whether you place them on setter methods or fields. For
        consistency with the annotation support introduced in Spring 2.5, you
        may choose either Spring's <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename>
        annotation or the <interfacename>@Resource</interfacename> annotation
        from JSR 250. The semantics for both are consistent throughout the Spring
        Framework. For example, if you prefer <link
        linkend="beans-factory-autowire"><emphasis>autowiring by
        type</emphasis></link>, annotate your setter methods or fields with
        <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename>. On the other hand, if you
        prefer to have your dependencies injected <emphasis>by
        name</emphasis>, annotate your setter methods or fields with
        <interfacename>@Resource</interfacename>.</para>

        <tip>
          <para>The TestContext framework does not instrument the manner in
          which a test instance is instantiated. Thus the use of
          <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> for constructors has no
          effect for test classes.</para>
        </tip>

        <para>Since <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> performs <link
        linkend="beans-factory-autowire"><emphasis>autowiring by
        type</emphasis></link>, if you have multiple bean definitions of the
        same type, you cannot rely on this approach for those particular
        beans. In that case, you can use
        <interfacename>@Resource</interfacename> for injection <emphasis>by
        name</emphasis>. Alternatively, if your test class has access to its
        <classname>ApplicationContext</classname>, you can perform an explicit
        lookup using (for example) a call to
        <methodname>applicationContext.getBean("titleDao")</methodname>. A
        third option is to use <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename>
        in conjunction with <interfacename>@Qualifier</interfacename>.
        </para>

        <para>If you don't want dependency injection applied to your test
        instances, simply don't annotate any fields or setter methods with
        <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> or
        <interfacename>@Resource</interfacename>. Alternatively, you can
        disable dependency injection altogether by explicitly configuring your
        class with <interfacename>@TestExecutionListeners</interfacename> and
        omitting
        <literal>DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener.class</literal> from
        the list of listeners.</para>

        <para>Consider the scenario where we have a class,

        itself which uses <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> for field
        injection (we will look at the application context configuration after
        all sample code listings). <emphasis>Note: The dependency injection
        behavior in the following code listings is not in any way specific to

&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>

        <note>
          <para>If you are extending from a Spring-provided test base class that happens
          to use <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> on one of its setters methods,
          you might have multiple beans of the affected type defined in your application context:
          e.g. multiple <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename> beans. In such a case,
          you may override the setter and use the <interfacename>@Qualifier</interfacename>
          annotation to indicate a specific target bean as follows:</para>

          <programlisting language="java">...
    @Override @Autowired
    public void setDataSource(<emphasis role="bold">@Qualifier("myDataSource")</emphasis> DataSource dataSource) {
        super.setDataSource(dataSource);
    }
...</programlisting>

          <para>The specified qualifier value indicates the specific
          <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename> bean to inject,
          narrowing the set of type matches to a specific bean.
          Its value is matched against <literal>&lt;qualifier&gt;</literal>
          declarations within the corresponding <literal>&lt;bean&gt;</literal>
          definitions. The bean name is used as a fallback qualifier value,
          so you may effectively also point to a specific bean by name there
          (as shown above, assuming that "myDataSource" is the bean id).
          If there is only one <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename> bean
          to begin with, then the qualifier will simply not have any effect
          - independent from the bean name of that single matching bean.</para>

          <para>Alternatively, consider using the <interfacename>@Resource</interfacename>
          annotation on such an overridden setter methods, defining the
          target bean name explicitly - with no type matching semantics.
          Note that this always points to a bean with that specific name,
          no matter whether there is one or more beans of the given type.</para>

          <programlisting language="java">...
    @Override <emphasis role="bold">@Resource("myDataSource")</emphasis>
    public void setDataSource(DataSource dataSource) {
        super.setDataSource(dataSource);

      <section id="testcontext-tx">
        <title>Transaction management</title>

        <para>In the TestContext framework, transactions are managed by the
        <classname>TransactionalTestExecutionListener</classname>, which is
        configured via the
        <interfacename>@TestExecutionListeners</interfacename> annotation by
        default, even if you do not explicitly declare
        <interfacename>@TestExecutionListeners</interfacename> on your test
        class. To enable support for transactions, however, you must provide a
        <classname>PlatformTransactionManager</classname> bean in the
        application context loaded via
        <interfacename>@ContextConfiguration</interfacename> semantics. In
        addition, you must declare
        <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename> either at the class or
        method level.</para>

        <para>For class-level transaction configuration (i.e., setting the
        bean name for the transaction manager and the default rollback flag),
        see the <interfacename>@TransactionConfiguration</interfacename> entry
        in the <link linkend="integration-testing-annotations">annotation support</link>
        section.</para>

        <para>There are several options for configuring transactions for
        individual test methods. If transactions are not enabled for the
        entire test class, methods may be explicitly annotated with
        <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename>. Similarly, if
        transactions <emphasis>are</emphasis> enabled for the entire test
        class, methods may be explicitly flagged not to run within a
        transaction by annotating them with
        <interfacename>@NotTransactional</interfacename>. To control whether
        or not a transaction should commit for a particular test method, you
        may use the <interfacename>@Rollback</interfacename> annotation to
        override the class-level default rollback setting.</para>

        <para><emphasis>Note that <link
        linkend="testcontext-support-classes-junit38"><classname>AbstractTransactionalJUnit38SpringContextTests</classname></link>,

        are pre-configured for transactional support at the class level.
        </emphasis></para>

        <para>You will occasionally find that you need to execute certain code
        before or after a transactional test method but outside the
        transactional context, for example to verify the initial database
        state prior to execution of your test or to verify expected
        transactional commit behavior after test execution (e.g., if the test
        was configured not to roll back the transaction).
        <classname>TransactionalTestExecutionListener</classname> supports the
        <interfacename>@BeforeTransaction</interfacename> and
        <interfacename>@AfterTransaction</interfacename> annotations exactly
        for such scenarios. Simply annotate any <literal>public void</literal>
        method in your test class with one of these annotations, and the
        <classname>TransactionalTestExecutionListener</classname> will ensure
        that your <emphasis>before transaction method</emphasis> or
        <emphasis>after transaction method</emphasis> is executed at the
        appropriate time.</para>

        <tip>
          <para>Any <emphasis>before methods</emphasis> (e.g., methods
          annotated with JUnit 4's @Before) and any <emphasis>after
          methods</emphasis> (e.g., methods annotated with JUnit 4's @After)
          will be executed <emphasis role="bold">within</emphasis> a
          transaction. In addition, methods annotated with
          <interfacename>@BeforeTransaction</interfacename> or

          <para>The <emphasis>Spring TestContext Framework</emphasis> offers

          developers can implement standard JUnit 4.5 unit and integration

      <title>PetClinic example</title>

      <para>The PetClinic sample application included with the full Spring
      distribution illustrates several features of the <emphasis>Spring
      TestContext Framework</emphasis> in a JUnit 4.5 environment. Most test
      functionality is included in the
      <classname>AbstractClinicTests</classname>, for which a partial listing
      is shown below:</para>

      <programlisting language="java"><emphasis role="bold">@ContextConfiguration</emphasis>
public abstract class AbstractClinicTests <emphasis role="bold">extends AbstractTransactionalJUnit4SpringContextTests</emphasis> {

    <emphasis role="bold">@Autowired</emphasis>

    @Test

        Collection&lt;Vet&gt; vets = this.clinic.getVets();
        assertEquals("JDBC query must show the same number of vets",

        Vet v1 = EntityUtils.getById(vets, Vet.class, 2);
        assertEquals("Leary", v1.getLastName());

          <para>This test case extends the
          <classname>AbstractTransactionalJUnit4SpringContextTests</classname>
          class, from which it inherits configuration for Dependency Injection
          (via the
          <classname>DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener</classname>) and
          transactional behavior (via the
          <classname>TransactionalTestExecutionListener</classname>).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The <literal>clinic</literal> instance variable - the
          application object being tested - is set by Dependency Injection via
          <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> semantics.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The <methodname>testGetVets()</methodname> method illustrates
          how the inherited <methodname>countRowsInTable()</methodname> method
          can be used to easily verify the number of rows in a given table,
          thus testing correct behavior of the application code being tested.
          This allows for stronger tests and lessens dependency on the exact
          test data. For example, you can add additional rows in the database
          without breaking tests.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Like many integration tests using a database, most of the
          tests in <classname>AbstractClinicTests</classname> depend on a
          minimum amount of data already in the database before the test cases
          run. You might, however, choose to populate the database in your
          test cases also - again, within the same transaction.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The PetClinic application supports three data access technologies
      - JDBC, Hibernate, and JPA. By declaring
      <interfacename>@ContextConfiguration</interfacename> without any
      specific resource locations, the
      <classname>AbstractClinicTests</classname> class will have its
      application context loaded from the default location,
      <literal>"AbstractClinicTests-context.xml"</literal>, which declares a
      common <classname>DataSource</classname>. Subclasses specify additional
      context locations which must declare a
      <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename> and a concrete
      implementation of <interfacename>Clinic</interfacename>.</para>

      <para>For example, the Hibernate implementation of the PetClinic tests
      contains the following implementation. Note that for this example,
      <classname>HibernateClinicTests</classname> does not contain a single
      line of code: we only need to declare
      <interfacename>@ContextConfiguration</interfacename>, and the tests are
      inherited from <classname>AbstractClinicTests</classname>. Since
      <interfacename>@ContextConfiguration</interfacename> is declared without
      any specific resource locations, the <emphasis>Spring TestContext
      Framework</emphasis> will load an application context from all the beans
      defined in <literal>"AbstractClinicTests-context.xml"</literal> (i.e.,
      the inherited locations) and
      <literal>"HibernateClinicTests-context.xml"</literal>, with
      <literal>"HibernateClinicTests-context.xml"</literal> possibly
      overriding beans defined in
      <literal>"AbstractClinicTests-context.xml"</literal>.</para>

      <programlisting language="java"><emphasis role="bold">@ContextConfiguration</emphasis>
public class HibernateClinicTests extends AbstractClinicTests { }
</programlisting>

      <para>As you can see in the PetClinic application, the Spring
      configuration is split across multiple files. As is typical of large
      scale applications, configuration locations will often be specified in a
      common base class for all application-specific integration tests. Such a
      base class may also add useful instance variables - populated by
      Dependency Injection, naturally - such as a
      <classname>HibernateTemplate</classname>, in the case of an application
      using Hibernate.</para>

      <para>As far as possible, you should have exactly the same Spring
      configuration files in your integration tests as in the deployed
      environment. One likely point of difference concerns database connection
      pooling and transaction infrastructure. If you are deploying to a
      full-blown application server, you will probably use its connection pool
      (available through JNDI) and JTA implementation. Thus in production you
      will use a <classname>JndiObjectFactoryBean</classname> for the
      <classname>DataSource</classname> and
      <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname>. JNDI and JTA will not be
      available in out-of-container integration tests, so you should use a
      combination like the Commons DBCP <classname>BasicDataSource</classname>
      and <classname>DataSourceTransactionManager</classname> or
      <classname>HibernateTransactionManager</classname> for them. You can
      factor out this variant behavior into a single XML file, having the
      choice between application server and 'local' configuration separated
      from all other configuration, which will not vary between the test and
      production environments. In addition, it is advisable to use properties
      files for connection settings: see the PetClinic application for an
      example.</para>
