    <para>The Spring team considers developer testing to be an absolutely
    integral part of enterprise software development. A thorough treatment of
    testing in the enterprise is beyond the scope of this chapter; rather, the
    focus here is on the value-add that the adoption of the IoC principle can
    bring to <link linkend="unit-testing">unit testing</link> and on the
    benefits that the Spring Framework provides in <link
    linkend="integration-testing">integration testing</link>.</para>

    <title>Unit testing</title>

    <para>One of the main benefits of Dependency Injection is that your code
    should really depend far less on the container than in traditional J2EE
    development. The POJOs that comprise your application should be testable
    in JUnit or TestNG tests, with objects simply instantiated using the
    <literal>new</literal> operator, <emphasis>without Spring or any other
    container</emphasis>. You can use <link linkend="mock-objects">mock
    objects</link> (in conjunction with many other valuable testing
    techniques) to test your code in isolation. If you follow the architecture
    recommendations around Spring you will find that the resulting clean
    layering and componentization of your codebase will naturally facilitate
    <emphasis>easier</emphasis> unit testing. For example, you will be able to
    test service layer objects by stubbing or mocking DAO or Repository
    interfaces, without any need to access persistent data while running unit
    tests.</para>

    <para>True unit tests typically will run extremely quickly, as there is no
    runtime infrastructure to set up, whether application server, database,
    ORM tool, or whatever. Thus emphasizing true unit tests as part of your
    development methodology will boost your productivity. The upshot of this
    is that you often do not need this section of the testing chapter to help
    you write effective <emphasis>unit</emphasis> tests for your IoC-based
    applications. For certain unit testing scenarios, however, the Spring
    Framework provides the following mock objects and testing support
    classes.</para>

        setting up a simple JNDI environment for test suites or stand-alone
        applications. If, for example, JDBC <classname>DataSource</classname>s
        get bound to the same JNDI names in test code as within a J2EE
        container, both application code and configuration can be reused in
        testing scenarios without modification.</para>

      <title>Overview</title>

      <para>It is important to be able to perform some integration testing
      without requiring deployment to your application server or connecting to
      other enterprise infrastructure. This will enable you to test things
      such as:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The correct wiring of your Spring IoC container
          contexts.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Data access using JDBC or an ORM tool. This would include such
          things as the correctness of SQL statements, Hibernate queries, JPA
          entity mappings, etc.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The Spring Framework provides first class support for integration
      testing in the form of the classes that are packaged in the <filename
      class="libraryfile">spring-test.jar</filename> library. In this library,
      you will find the <literal>org.springframework.test</literal> package
      which contains valuable classes for integration testing using a Spring
      container, while at the same time not being reliant on an application
      server or other deployment environment. Such tests will be slower to run
      than unit tests but much faster to run than the equivalent Cactus tests
      or remote tests relying on deployment to an application server.</para>

      <para>Prior to the 2.5 release of the framework, Spring provided <link
      linkend="junit38-legacy-support">integration testing support specific to
      JUnit 3.8</link>. As of the 2.5 release, Spring offers support for unit
      and integration testing in the form of the <link
      linkend="testcontext-framework">Spring TestContext Framework</link>,
      which is agnostic of the actual testing framework in use, thus allowing
      instrumentation of tests in various environments including JUnit 3.8,
      JUnit 4.4, TestNG, etc. <emphasis>Note that the Spring TestContext
      Framework requires Java 5+.</emphasis></para>

      <title>Which support framework to use</title>

      <para>The Spring team recommends using the <link

      all new unit testing or integration testing involving
      <classname>ApplicationContext</classname>s or requiring transactional
      test fixtures; however, if you are developing in a pre-Java 5
      environment, you will need to continue to use the <link

      addition, explicit <link linkend="junit38-legacy-jpa-tests">integration
      testing support for JPA</link> which relies on <emphasis>shadow class
      loading</emphasis> for JPA class instrumentation is currently only
      available with the JUnit 3.8 legacy support. If you are testing against
      a JPA provider which does not require class instrumentation, however, it
      is recommended that you use the TestContext framework.</para>

    <section id="integration-testing-common-goals">
      <title>Common goals</title>

      <para>The Spring integration testing support frameworks share several

          support classes</link> that are really useful when writing
          integration tests.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The following sections outline each of these goals and provide
      direct links to information specific to the particular support
      frameworks.</para>

      <section id="testing-ctx-management">
        <title>Context management and caching</title>

        <para>Spring integration testing support frameworks provide consistent
        loading of Spring <classname>ApplicationContext</classname>s and
        caching of those contexts. Support for the caching of loaded contexts
        is important, because if you are working on a large project, startup
        time may become an issue - not because of the overhead of Spring
        itself, but because the objects instantiated by the Spring container
        will themselves take time to instantiate. For example, a project with
        50-100 Hibernate mapping files might take 10-20 seconds to load the
        mapping files, and incurring that cost before running every single
        test in every single test fixture will lead to slower overall test
        runs that could reduce productivity.</para>

        <para>Test classes will generally provide an array containing the
        resource locations of XML configuration metadata - typically on the
        classpath - used to configure the application. This will be the same,
        or nearly the same, as the list of configuration locations specified
        in <literal>web.xml</literal> or other deployment
        configuration.</para>

        <para>By default, once loaded, the configured
        <interfacename>ApplicationContext</interfacename> will be reused for
        each test. Thus the setup cost will be incurred only once (per test
        fixture), and subsequent test execution will be much faster. In the
        unlikely case that a test may 'dirty' the application context,
        requiring reloading - for example, by changing a bean definition or
        the state of an application object - Spring's testing support provides
        mechanisms to cause the test fixture to reload the configurations and
        rebuild the application context before executing the next test.</para>

      <section id="testing-fixture-di">
        <title>Dependency Injection of test fixtures</title>

        <para>When Spring integration testing support frameworks load your
        application context, they can optionally configure instances of your
        test classes via Dependency Injection. This provides a convenient
        mechanism for setting up test fixtures using pre-configured beans from
        your application context. A strong benefit here is that you can reuse
        application contexts across various testing scenarios (e.g., for
        configuring Spring-managed object graphs, transactional proxies,
        <classname>DataSource</classname>s, etc.), thus avoiding the need to
        duplicate complex test fixture set up for individual test
        cases.</para>

        <para>As an example, consider the scenario where we have a class,
        <classname>HibernateTitleDao</classname>, that performs data access
        logic for say, the <classname>Title</classname> domain object. We want
        to write integration tests that test all of the following
        areas:</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>The Spring configuration: basically, is everything related

          <listitem>
            <para>The logic of the <classname>HibernateTitleDao</classname>:

      <section id="testing-tx">
        <title>Transaction management</title>

        <para>One common issue in tests that access a real database is their
        affect on the state of the persistence store. Even when you're using a
        development database, changes to the state may affect future tests.
        Also, many operations - such as inserting to or modifying persistent
        data - cannot be performed (or verified) outside a transaction.</para>

        <para>The Spring integration testing support frameworks meet this
        need. By default, they create and roll back a transaction for each
        test. You simply write code that can assume the existence of a
        transaction. If you call transactionally proxied objects in your
        tests, they will behave correctly, according to their transactional
        semantics. In addition, if test methods delete the contents of
        selected tables while running within a transaction, the transaction
        will roll back by default, and the database will return to its state
        prior to execution of the test. Transactional support is provided to
        your test class via a
        <classname>PlatformTransactionManager</classname> bean defined in the
        test's application context.</para>

        <para>If you want a transaction to commit - unusual, but occasionally
        useful when you want a particular test to populate or modify the
        database - the Spring integration testing support frameworks can be
        instructed to cause the transaction to commit instead of roll back
        either by calling an inherited hook-method or by declaring a specific
        annotation.</para>

        <para>Implementations of this method must provide an array containing

        <para>Typically you will extend the subclass,

        This class also requires that a <classname>DataSource</classname> bean
        definition - again, with any name - be present in the application
        context. It creates a <classname>JdbcTemplate</classname> instance
        variable, that is useful for convenient querying, and provides handy
        methods to delete the contents of selected tables (remember that the
        transaction will roll back by default, so this is safe to do).</para>

        <para>If you want a transaction to commit
        <emphasis>programmatically</emphasis> - unusual, but occasionally
        useful when you want a particular test to populate the database - you
        can call the <methodname>setComplete()</methodname> method inherited
        from <classname>AbstractTransactionalSpringContextTests</classname>.
        This will cause the transaction to commit instead of roll back. As an
        alternative, if you are developing against Java 5 or greater and
        extending <link
        linkend="junit38-legacy-annotation-aware-tests"><classname>AbstractAnnotationAwareTransactionalTests</classname></link>,
        you may annotate your test method with
        <interfacename>@Rollback(false)</interfacename> to achieve the same

        <para>There is also the convenient ability to end a transaction before
        the test case ends, by calling the
        <methodname>endTransaction()</methodname> method. This will roll back
        the transaction by default and commit it only if
        <methodname>setComplete()</methodname> had previously been called.
        This functionality is useful if you want to test the behavior of
        'disconnected' data objects, such as Hibernate-mapped entities that
        will be used in a web or remoting tier outside a transaction. Often,
        lazy loading errors are discovered only through UI testing; if you
        call <methodname>endTransaction()</methodname> you can ensure correct
        operation of the UI through your JUnit test suite.</para>

        <para>The core of the framework consists of the

        <classname>TestContextManager</classname> classes and the

        <classname>TestContextManager</classname> is created on a per-test
        basis. The <classname>TestContextManager</classname> in turn manages a
        <classname>TestContext</classname> which is responsible for holding
        the context of the current test. The

        updating the state of the <classname>TestContext</classname> as the
        test progresses and delegating to
        <interfacename>TestExecutionListener</interfacename>s, which
        instrument the actual test execution (e.g., providing dependency

      <section id="testcontext-ctx-management">
        <title>Context management and caching</title>

        <para>Each <classname>TestContext</classname> provides context
        management and caching support for the test instance for which it is
        responsible. Test instances do not automatically receive access to the
        configured <classname>ApplicationContext</classname>; however, if a
        test class implements the
        <interfacename>ApplicationContextAware</interfacename> interface, a
        reference to the <classname>ApplicationContext</classname> will be
        supplied to the test instance (provided the
        <classname>DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener</classname> has
        been configured, which is the default). Note that
        <classname>AbstractJUnit38SpringContextTests</classname>,
        <classname>AbstractJUnit4SpringContextTests</classname>, and
        <classname>AbstractTestNGSpringContextTests</classname> already
        implement <interfacename>ApplicationContextAware</interfacename> and
        therefore provide this functionality out-of-the-box.</para>

        <para>In contrast to the JUnit 3.8 legacy support, test classes which
        use the TestContext framework do not need to override any
        <literal>protected</literal> instance methods to configure their
        application context. Rather, configuration is achieved merely by
        declaring the <interfacename>@ContextConfiguration</interfacename>
        annotation at the class level. If your test class does not explicitly
        declare any application context resource <literal>locations</literal>,
        the configured <interfacename>ContextLoader</interfacename> will
        determine how and whether or not to load a context from a default set
        of locations. For example,
        <classname>GenericXmlContextLoader</classname> - which is the default
        <interfacename>ContextLoader</interfacename> - will generate a default
        location based on the name of the test class. If your class is named
        <literal>com.example.MyTest</literal>,
        <classname>GenericXmlContextLoader</classname> will load your
        application context from
        <literal>"classpath:/com/example/MyTest-context.xml"</literal>.</para>

public class MyTest {
    <lineannotation>// class body...</lineannotation>
}</programlisting>

        <para>If the default location does not suit your needs, you are free
        to explicitly configure the <literal>locations</literal> attribute of
        <interfacename>@ContextConfiguration</interfacename> (see code listing
        below) with an array containing the resource locations of XML
        configuration metadata (assuming an XML-capable
        <interfacename>ContextLoader</interfacename> has been configured) -
        typically on the classpath - used to configure the application. This
        will be the same, or nearly the same, as the list of configuration
        locations specified in <literal>web.xml</literal> or other deployment
        configuration. As an alternative you may choose to implement and
        configure your own custom
        <interfacename>ContextLoader</interfacename>.</para>

<emphasis role="bold">@ContextConfiguration(locations={"/applicationContext.xml", "/applicationContext-test.xml"})</emphasis>
public class MyTest {
    <lineannotation>// class body...</lineannotation>
}</programlisting>

        <para><interfacename>@ContextConfiguration</interfacename> also
        supports a boolean <literal>inheritLocations</literal> attribute which
        denotes whether or not resource locations from superclasses should be
        <emphasis>inherited</emphasis>. The default value is
        <literal>true</literal>, which means that an annotated class will
        <emphasis>inherit</emphasis> the resource locations defined by an
        annotated superclass. Specifically, the resource locations for an
        annotated class will be appended to the list of resource locations
        defined by an annotated superclass. Thus, subclasses have the option
        of <emphasis>extending</emphasis> the list of resource locations. In
        the following example, the
        <interfacename>ApplicationContext</interfacename> for
        <classname>ExtendedTest</classname> will be loaded from
        "/base-context.xml" <emphasis role="bold">and</emphasis>
        "/extended-context.xml", in that order. Beans defined in

        <para>If <literal>inheritLocations</literal> is set to

        <para>By default, once loaded, the configured
        <interfacename>ApplicationContext</interfacename> will be reused for
        each test. Thus the setup cost will be incurred only once (per test
        fixture), and subsequent test execution will be much faster. In the
        unlikely case that a test may <emphasis>dirty</emphasis> the
        application context, requiring reloading - for example, by changing a
        bean definition or the state of an application object - you may
        annotate your test method with
        <interfacename>@DirtiesContext</interfacename> (assuming
        <classname>DirtiesContextTestExecutionListener</classname> has been
        configured, which is the default) to cause the test fixture to reload
        the configurations and rebuild the application context before
        executing the next test.</para>

      <section id="testcontext-fixture-di">
        <title>Dependency Injection of test fixtures</title>

        <para>When you configure the
        <classname>DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener</classname> -
        which is configured by default - via the
        <interfacename>@TestExecutionListeners</interfacename> annotation, the
        dependencies of your test instances will be
        <emphasis>injected</emphasis> from beans in the application context
        you configured via
        <interfacename>@ContextConfiguration</interfacename> by Setter
        Injection, Field Injection, or both, depending on which annotations
        you choose and whether you place them on setter methods or fields. For
        consistency with annotation support in Spring 2.5, you may choose
        either Spring's <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> annotation
        or the <interfacename>@Resource</interfacename> annotation from JSR
        250. The semantics for both are consistent throughout the Spring
        Framework. For example, if you prefer <link
        linkend="beans-factory-autowire"><emphasis>autowiring by
        type</emphasis></link>, annotate your setter methods or fields with
        <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename>. On the other hand, if you
        prefer to have your dependencies injected <emphasis>by
        name</emphasis>, annotate your setter methods or fields with
        <interfacename>@Resource</interfacename>.</para>

        <tip>
          <para>The TestContext framework does not instrument the manner in
          which a test instance is instantiated. Thus the use of
          <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> for constructors has no
          effect for test classes.</para>
        </tip>

        <para>Since <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> performs <link
        linkend="beans-factory-autowire"><emphasis>autowiring by
        type</emphasis></link>, if you have multiple bean definitions of the
        same type, you cannot rely on this approach for those particular
        beans. In that case, you can use
        <interfacename>@Resource</interfacename> for injection <emphasis>by
        name</emphasis>. Alternatively, if your test class implements
        <classname>ApplicationContextAware</classname>, you can directly
        access the <classname>ApplicationContext</classname> supplied to your
        test and perform an explicit lookup using (for example) a call to
        <methodname>applicationContext.getBean("titleDao")</methodname>.</para>

        <para>If you don't want dependency injection applied to your test
        instances, simply don't annotate any fields or setter methods with
        <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> or
        <interfacename>@Resource</interfacename>. Alternatively, you can
        disable dependency injection altogether by explicitly configuring your
        class with <interfacename>@TestExecutionListeners</interfacename> and
        omitting
        <literal>DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener.class</literal> from
        the list of listeners.</para>

        <para>Consider the scenario where we have a class,
        <classname>HibernateTitleDao</classname> (as outlined in the <link
        linkend="testing-fixture-di">common goals</link> section). First,
        let's look at a JUnit 4.4 based implementation of the test class
        itself which uses <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> for field
        injection (we will look at the application context configuration after
        all sample code listings). <emphasis>Note: The dependency injection
        behavior in the following code listings is not in any way specific to
        JUnit 4.4. The same DI techniques can be used in conjunction with any

&lt;/beans&gt;</programlisting>

        <note>
          <para>If you are extending from a Spring-provided test base class that happens
          to use <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> on one of its setters methods,
          you might have multiple beans of the affected type defined in your application context:
          e.g. multiple <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename> beans. In such a case,
          you may override the setter and use the <interfacename>@Qualifier</interfacename>
          annotation to indicate a specific target bean as follows:</para>

          <programlisting>...
    @Override @Autowired
    public void setDataSource(<emphasis role="bold">@Qualifier("myDataSource")</emphasis> DataSource dataSource) {
        super.setDataSource(dataSource);
    }
...</programlisting>

          <para>The specified qualifier value indicates the specific
          <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename> bean to inject,
          narrowing the set of type matches to a specific bean.
          Its value is matched against <literal>&lt;qualifier&gt;</literal>
          declarations within the corresponding <literal>&lt;bean&gt;</literal>
          definitions. The bean name is used as a fallback qualifier value,
          so you may effectively also point to a specific bean by name there
          (as shown above, assuming that "myDataSource" is the bean id).
          If there is only one <interfacename>DataSource</interfacename> bean
          to begin with, then the qualifier will simply not have any effect
          - independent from the bean name of that single matching bean.</para>

          <para>Alternatively, consider using the <interfacename>@Resource</interfacename>
          annotation on such an overridden setter methods, defining the
          target bean name explicitly - with no type matching semantics.
          Note that this always points to a bean with that specific name,
          no matter whether there is one or more beans of the given type.</para>

          <programlisting>...
    @Override <emphasis role="bold">@Resource("myDataSource")</emphasis>
    public void setDataSource(DataSource dataSource) {
        super.setDataSource(dataSource);

        <title>Transaction management</title>

        <para>In the TestContext framework, transactions are managed by the
        <classname>TransactionalTestExecutionListener</classname>, which is
        configured via the
        <interfacename>@TestExecutionListeners</interfacename> annotation by
        default, even if you do not explicitly declare
        <interfacename>@TestExecutionListeners</interfacename> on your test
        class. To enable support for transactions, however, you must provide a
        <classname>PlatformTransactionManager</classname> bean in the
        application context loaded via
        <interfacename>@ContextConfiguration</interfacename> semantics. In
        addition, you must declare
        <interfacename>@Transactional</interfacename> either at the class or
        method level.</para>

        <para>For class-level transaction configuration (i.e., setting the

        <para>There are several options for configuring transactions for
        individual test methods. If transactions are not enabled for the

        transactions <emphasis>are</emphasis> enabled for the entire test
        class, methods may be explicitly flagged not to run within a
        transaction by annotating them with
        <interfacename>@NotTransactional</interfacename>. To control whether
        or not a transaction should commit for a particular test method, you
        may use the <interfacename>@Rollback</interfacename> annotation to
        override the class-level default rollback setting.</para>

        <para>You will occasionally find that you need to execute certain code
        before or after a transactional test method but outside the
        transactional context, for example to verify the initial database
        state prior to execution of your test or to verify expected
        transactional commit behavior after test execution (e.g., if the test
        was configured not to roll back the transaction).
        <classname>TransactionalTestExecutionListener</classname> supports the
        <interfacename>@BeforeTransaction</interfacename> and
        <interfacename>@AfterTransaction</interfacename> annotations exactly
        for such scenarios. Simply annotate any <literal>public void</literal>
        method in your test class with one of these annotations, and the
        <classname>TransactionalTestExecutionListener</classname> will ensure
        that your <emphasis>before transaction method</emphasis> or
        <emphasis>after transaction method</emphasis> is executed at the
        appropriate time.</para>

        <tip>
          <para>Any <emphasis>before methods</emphasis> (e.g., methods
          annotated with JUnit 4's @Before) and any <emphasis>after
          methods</emphasis> (e.g., methods annotated with JUnit 4's @After)
          will be executed <emphasis role="bold">within</emphasis> a
          transaction. In addition, methods annotated with
          <interfacename>@BeforeTransaction</interfacename> or

      <title>PetClinic example</title>

      <para>The PetClinic sample application included with the full Spring
      distribution illustrates several features of the <emphasis>Spring
      TestContext Framework</emphasis> in a JUnit 4.4 environment. Most test
      functionality is included in the
      <classname>AbstractClinicTests</classname>, for which a partial listing
      is shown below:</para>

      <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">@ContextConfiguration</emphasis>
public abstract class AbstractClinicTests <emphasis role="bold">extends AbstractTransactionalJUnit4SpringContextTests</emphasis> {

    <emphasis role="bold">@Autowired</emphasis>
    protected Clinic clinic;

    @Test
    public void getVets() {
        Collection&lt;Vet&gt; vets = this.clinic.getVets();
        assertEquals("JDBC query must show the same number of vets",

      <para>Notes:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>This test case extends the
          <classname>AbstractTransactionalJUnit4SpringContextTests</classname>
          class, from which it inherits configuration for Dependency Injection
          (via the
          <classname>DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener</classname>) and
          transactional behavior (via the
          <classname>TransactionalTestExecutionListener</classname>).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The <literal>clinic</literal> instance variable - the
          application object being tested - is set by Dependency Injection via
          <interfacename>@Autowired</interfacename> semantics.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The <methodname>testGetVets()</methodname> method illustrates
          how the inherited <methodname>countRowsInTable()</methodname> method
          can be used to easily verify the number of rows in a given table,
          thus testing correct behavior of the application code being tested.
          This allows for stronger tests and lessens dependency on the exact
          test data. For example, you can add additional rows in the database
          without breaking tests.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Like many integration tests using a database, most of the
          tests in <classname>AbstractClinicTests</classname> depend on a
          minimum amount of data already in the database before the test cases
          run. You might, however, choose to populate the database in your
          test cases also - again, within the same transaction.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The PetClinic application supports three data access technologies
      - JDBC, Hibernate, and JPA. By declaring
      <interfacename>@ContextConfiguration</interfacename> without any
      specific resource locations, the
      <classname>AbstractClinicTests</classname> class will have its
      application context loaded from the default location,
      <literal>"AbstractClinicTests-context.xml"</literal>, which declares a
      common <classname>DataSource</classname>. Subclasses specify additional
      context locations which must declare a
      <interfacename>PlatformTransactionManager</interfacename> and a concrete
      implementation of <interfacename>Clinic</interfacename>.</para>

      <para>For example, the Hibernate implementation of the PetClinic tests
      contains the following implementation. Note that for this example,
      <classname>HibernateClinicTests</classname> does not contain a single
      line of code: we only need to declare
      <interfacename>@ContextConfiguration</interfacename>, and the tests are
      inherited from <classname>AbstractClinicTests</classname>. Since
      <interfacename>@ContextConfiguration</interfacename> is declared without
      any specific resource locations, the <emphasis>Spring TestContext
      Framework</emphasis> will load an application context from all the beans
      defined in <literal>"AbstractClinicTests-context.xml"</literal> (i.e.,
      the inherited locations) and
      <literal>"HibernateClinicTests-context.xml"</literal>, with
      <literal>"HibernateClinicTests-context.xml"</literal> possibly
      overriding beans defined in
      <literal>"AbstractClinicTests-context.xml"</literal>.</para>

      <programlisting><emphasis role="bold">@ContextConfiguration</emphasis>
public class HibernateClinicTests extends AbstractClinicTests { }
</programlisting>

      <para>As you can see in the PetClinic application, the Spring
      configuration is split across multiple files. As is typical of large
      scale applications, configuration locations will often be specified in a
      common base class for all application-specific integration tests. Such a
      base class may also add useful instance variables - populated by
      Dependency Injection, naturally - such as a
      <classname>HibernateTemplate</classname>, in the case of an application
      using Hibernate.</para>

      <para>As far as possible, you should have exactly the same Spring
      configuration files in your integration tests as in the deployed
      environment. One likely point of difference concerns database connection
      pooling and transaction infrastructure. If you are deploying to a
      full-blown application server, you will probably use its connection pool
      (available through JNDI) and JTA implementation. Thus in production you
      will use a <classname>JndiObjectFactoryBean</classname> for the
      <classname>DataSource</classname> and
      <classname>JtaTransactionManager</classname>. JNDI and JTA will not be
      available in out-of-container integration tests, so you should use a
      combination like the Commons DBCP <classname>BasicDataSource</classname>
      and <classname>DataSourceTransactionManager</classname> or
      <classname>HibernateTransactionManager</classname> for them. You can
      factor out this variant behavior into a single XML file, having the
      choice between application server and 'local' configuration separated
      from all other configuration, which will not vary between the test and
      production environments. In addition, it is advisable to use properties
      files for connection settings: see the PetClinic application for an
      example.</para>
