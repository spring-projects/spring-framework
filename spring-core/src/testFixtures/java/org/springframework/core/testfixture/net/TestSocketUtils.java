/**
 * Simple utility for finding available TCP ports on {@code localhost} for use in
 * integration testing scenarios.
 *
 * <p>{@code SocketUtils} was removed from the public API in {@code spring-core}
 * in Spring Framework 6.0 and reintroduced as {@code TestSocketUtils}, which is
 * made available to all tests in Spring Framework's test suite as a Gradle
 * <em>test fixture</em>.
 *
 * <p>{@code SocketUtils} was introduced in Spring Framework 4.0, primarily to
 * assist in writing integration tests which start an external server on an
 * available random port. However, these utilities make no guarantee about the
 * subsequent availability of a given port and are therefore unreliable. Instead
 * of using {@code TestSocketUtils} to find an available local port for a server,
 * it is recommended that you rely on a server's ability to start on a random port
 * that it selects or is assigned by the operating system. To interact with that
 * server, you should query the server for the port it is currently using.
