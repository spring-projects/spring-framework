 * Interface to be implemented by transparent resource proxies that need to be
 * considered as equal to the underlying resource, for example for consistent
 * lookup key comparisons. Note that this interface does imply such special
 * semantics and does not constitute a general-purpose mixin!
 *
 * <p>Such wrappers will automatically be unwrapped for key comparisons in
 * {@link org.springframework.transaction.support.TransactionSynchronizationManager}.
 *
 * <p>Only fully transparent proxies, for example, for redirection or service lookups,
 * are supposed to implement this interface. Proxies that decorate the target
 * object with new behavior, such as AOP proxies, do <i>not</i> qualify here!
