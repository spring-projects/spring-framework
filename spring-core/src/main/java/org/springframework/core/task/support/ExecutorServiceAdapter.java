/**
 * Adapter that takes a Spring {@link org.springframework.core.task.TaskExecutor}
 * and exposes a full {@code java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService} for it.
 *
 * <p>This is primarily for adapting to client components that communicate via the
 * {@code java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService} API. It can also be used as
 * common ground between a local Spring {@code TaskExecutor} backend and a
 * JNDI-located {@code ManagedExecutorService} in a Jakarta EE environment.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> This ExecutorService adapter does <em>not</em> support the
 * lifecycle methods in the {@code java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService} API
 * ("shutdown()" etc.), similar to a server-wide {@code ManagedExecutorService}
 * in a Jakarta EE environment. The lifecycle is always up to the backend pool,
 * with this adapter acting as an access-only proxy for that target pool.
