/**
 * {@link TaskExecutor} implementation that fires up a new Thread for each task,
 * executing it asynchronously. Provides a virtual thread option on JDK 21.
 *
 * <p>Supports a graceful shutdown through {@link #setTaskTerminationTimeout},
 * at the expense of task tracking overhead per execution thread at runtime.
 * Supports limiting concurrent threads through {@link #setConcurrencyLimit}.
 * By default, the number of concurrent task executions is unlimited.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE: This implementation does not reuse threads!</b> Consider a
 * thread-pooling TaskExecutor implementation instead, in particular for
 * executing a large number of short-lived tasks. Alternatively, on JDK 21,
 * consider setting {@link #setVirtualThreads} to {@code true}.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE: This executor does not participate in context-level lifecycle
 * management.</b> Tasks on handed-off execution threads cannot be centrally
 * stopped and restarted; if such tight lifecycle management is necessary,
 * consider a common {@code ThreadPoolTaskExecutor} setup instead.
