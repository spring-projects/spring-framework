/**
 * Configuration interface to be implemented by most if not all {@link Environment} types.
 * Provides facilities for setting active and default profiles and manipulating underlying
 * property sources. Allows clients to set and validate required properties, customize the
 * conversion service and more through the {@link ConfigurablePropertyResolver}
 * superinterface.
 *
 * <h2>Manipulating property sources</h2>
 * <p>Property sources may be removed, reordered, or replaced; and additional
 * property sources may be added using the {@link MutablePropertySources}
 * instance returned from {@link #getPropertySources()}. The following examples
 * are against the {@link StandardEnvironment} implementation of
 * {@code ConfigurableEnvironment}, but are generally applicable to any implementation,
 * though particular default property sources may differ.
 *
 * <h4>Example: adding a new property source with highest search priority</h4>
 * <pre class="code">
 * ConfigurableEnvironment environment = new StandardEnvironment();
 * MutablePropertySources propertySources = environment.getPropertySources();
 * Map&lt;String, Object&gt; myMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
 * myMap.put("xyz", "myValue");
 * propertySources.addFirst(new MapPropertySource("MY_MAP", myMap));
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h4>Example: removing the default system properties property source</h4>
 * <pre class="code">
 * MutablePropertySources propertySources = environment.getPropertySources();
 * propertySources.remove(StandardEnvironment.SYSTEM_PROPERTIES_PROPERTY_SOURCE_NAME)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h4>Example: mocking the system environment for testing purposes</h4>
 * <pre class="code">
 * MutablePropertySources propertySources = environment.getPropertySources();
 * MockPropertySource mockEnvVars = new MockPropertySource().withProperty("xyz", "myValue");
 * propertySources.replace(StandardEnvironment.SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PROPERTY_SOURCE_NAME, mockEnvVars);
 * </pre>
 *
 * When an {@link Environment} is being used by an {@code ApplicationContext}, it is
 * important that any such {@code PropertySource} manipulations be performed
 * <em>before</em> the context's {@link
 * org.springframework.context.support.AbstractApplicationContext#refresh() refresh()}
 * method is called. This ensures that all property sources are available during the
 * container bootstrap process, including use by {@linkplain
 * org.springframework.context.support.PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer property
 * placeholder configurers}.
