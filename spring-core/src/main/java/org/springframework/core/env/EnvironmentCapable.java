/**
 * Interface indicating a component contains and makes available an {@link Environment} object. 
 *
 * <p>All Spring application contexts are EnvironmentCapable, and the interface is used primarily
 * for performing {@code instanceof} checks in framework methods that accept BeanFactory
 * instances that may or may not actually be ApplicationContext instances in order to interact
 * with the environment if indeed it is available.
 *
 * <p>As mentioned, {@link org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext ApplicationContext}
 * extends EnvironmentCapable, and thus exposes a {@link #getEnvironment()} method; however,
 * {@link org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext ConfigurableApplicationContext}
 * redefines {@link org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext#getEnvironment
 * getEnvironment()} and narrows the signature to return a {@link ConfigurableEnvironment}. The effect
 * is that an Environment object is 'read-only' until it accessed from a ConfigurableApplicationContext,
 * at which point it too may be configured.
