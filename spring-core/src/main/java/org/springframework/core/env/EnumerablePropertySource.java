/**
 * A {@link PropertySource} implementation capable of interrogating its
 * underlying source object to enumerate all possible property name/value
 * pairs. Exposes the {@link #getPropertyNames()} method to allow callers
 * to introspect available properties without having to access the underlying
 * source object. This also facilitates a more efficient implementation of
 * {@link #containsProperty(String)}, in that it can call {@link #getPropertyNames()}
 * and iterate through the returned array rather than attempting a call to
 * {@link #getProperty(String)} which may be more expensive. Implementations may
 * consider caching the result of {@link #getPropertyNames()} to fully exploit this
 * performance opportunity.
 *
 * <p>Most framework-provided {@code PropertySource} implementations are enumerable;
 * a counter-example would be {@code JndiPropertySource} where, due to the
 * nature of JNDI it is not possible to determine all possible property names at
 * any given time; rather it is only possible to try to access a property
 * (via {@link #getProperty(String)}) in order to evaluate whether it is present
 * or not.
