/**
 * {@link Environment} implementation suitable for use in 'standard' (i.e. non-web)
 * applications.
 *
 * <p>In addition to the usual functions of a {@link ConfigurableEnvironment} such as
 * property resolution and profile-related operations, this implementation configures two
 * default property sources, to be searched in the following order:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@linkplain AbstractEnvironment#getSystemProperties() system properties}
 * <li>{@linkplain AbstractEnvironment#getSystemEnvironment() system environment variables}
 * </ul>
 *
 * That is, if the key "xyz" is present both in the JVM system properties as well as in
 * the set of environment variables for the current process, the value of key "xyz" from
 * system properties will return from a call to {@code environment.getProperty("xyz")}.
 * This ordering is chosen by default because system properties are per-JVM, while
 * environment variables may be the same across many JVMs on a given system.  Giving
 * system properties precedence allows for overriding of environment variables on a
 * per-JVM basis.
 *
 * <p>These default property sources may be removed, reordered, or replaced; and
 * additional property sources may be added using the {@link MutablePropertySources}
 * instance available from {@link #getPropertySources()}. See
 * {@link ConfigurableEnvironment} Javadoc for usage examples.
 *
 * <p>See {@link SystemEnvironmentPropertySource} javadoc for details on special handling
 * of property names in shell environments (e.g. Bash) that disallow period characters in
 * variable names.
