/**
 * Spring's repackaging of
 * <a href="http://objenesis.org">Objenesis 3.1</a>
 * (with SpringObjenesis entry point; for internal use only).
 *
 * <p>This repackaging technique avoids any potential conflicts with
 * dependencies on different Objenesis versions at the application
 * level or from third-party libraries and frameworks.
 *
 * <p>As this repackaging happens at the class file level, sources
 * and javadocs are not available here. See the original
 * <a href="http://objenesis.org/tutorial.html">Objenesis docs</a>
 * for details when working with these classes.
