/**
 * Indicates whether a bean is to be lazily initialized.
 *
 * <p>May be used on any class directly or indirectly annotated with {@link
 * org.springframework.stereotype.Component @Component} or on methods annotated with
 * {@link Bean @Bean}.
 *
 * <p>If this annotation is not present on a {@code @Component} or {@code @Bean} definition,
 * eager initialization will occur. If present and set to {@code true}, the {@code @Bean} or
 * {@code @Component} will not be initialized until referenced by another bean or explicitly
 * retrieved from the enclosing {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory
 * BeanFactory}. If present and set to {@code false}, the bean will be instantiated on
 * startup by bean factories that perform eager initialization of singletons.
 *
 * <p>If Lazy is present on a {@link Configuration @Configuration} class, this
 * indicates that all {@code @Bean} methods within that {@code @Configuration}
 * should be lazily initialized. If {@code @Lazy} is present and false on a {@code @Bean}
 * method within a {@code @Lazy}-annotated {@code @Configuration} class, this indicates
 * overriding the 'default lazy' behavior and that the bean should be eagerly initialized.
