The simplest implementation of the JNDI SPI that could possibly work.

<p>Useful for setting up a simple JNDI environment for test suites
or standalone applications. If e.g. JDBC DataSources get bound to the
same JNDI names as within a J2EE container, both application code and
configuration can me reused without changes.
