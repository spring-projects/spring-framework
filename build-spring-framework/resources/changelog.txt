==========================
http://www.springsource.org


Changes in version 3.0.0.M2 (2009-02-20)
----------------------------------------

* refined OSGi version constraints for "javax.annotation" and "junit.framework"
* revised expression parser API design
* added SimpleThreadScope implementation
* "systemProperties" bean is not considered a default match for type Properties anymore
* registered plain singletons will be fully matched according to their qualifiers
* @Qualifier value matching takes chained aliases of target beans into account as well
* SimpleAliasRegistry's "getAliases" method returns transitive aliases now
* pre-converted property values are preserved more eagerly for re-created beans
* ASM-based AnnotationMetadata fully resolves class arguments and enums into Java types
* ProceedingJoinPoint resolves parameter names using ASM-based parameter name discovery
* MethodInvocations and ProceedingJoinPoints always expose original method (not bridge)
* bridge method resolution works with Hibernate-generated CGLIB proxies as well
* generic collection type resolution respects upper bound (e.g. ? extends Number) as well
* TypeUtils detects variations of ParameterizedType/GenericArrayType assignability as well
* ReflectionUtils findMethod detects methods on "java.lang.Object" as well
* UrlResource eagerly closes HTTP connections in case of "getInputStream()" failure
* PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver avoids NPE when initialized with null ClassLoader
* all "taskExecutor" bean properties now accept any "java.util.concurrent.Executor"
* added "Future submit(Runnable)" and "Future submit(Callable)" to AsyncTaskExecutor
* SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor supports a custom "java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory"
* SchedulingTaskExecutor interface extends AsyncTaskExecutor now
* added ThreadPoolExecutorFactoryBean (exposing the native ExecutorService interface)
* added ExecutorServiceAdapter class as a standard wrapper for a Spring TaskExecutor
* reduced backport-concurrent support to TaskExecutor adapters
* added @Async annotation and AsyncAnnotationAdvisor (namespace support coming in M3)
* EJB 3.1's @Asynchronous annotation gets detected and supported by default as well
* ApplicationListener beans get obtained on demand, supporting non-singletons as well
* ApplicationListeners will be called in the order according to the Ordered contract
* generified ApplicationListener interface, narrowing the event type to be received
* introduced SmartApplicationListener interface for supported event/source types
* generified Transaction/Hibernate/Jdo/JpaCallback with generic "doInXxx" return type
* HibernateOperations uses generic parameter/return types where possible
* JdoOperations uses generic parameter/return types where possible (following JDO 2.1)
* removed "flush" operation from JdoDialect (fully relying on JDO 2.0+ compliance now)
* added JDO 2.1 compliant StandardPersistenceManagerProxy/SpringPersistenceManagerProxy
* Spring-created EntityManagers support JPA 2.0 draft API ("unwrap", "getQueryBuilder")
* Spring initiates JPA 2.0 query timeout with remaining Spring transaction timeout
* added support for WebSphere's ResourceAdapter-managed messaging transactions
* made SpringBeanAutowiringInterceptor callback signature compatible with WebSphere
* WebSphereUowTransactionManager preserves original exception in case of rollback
* added "flush()" method to TransactionStatus and TransactionSynchronization interfaces
* test context manager automatically flushes transactions before rolling back
* DefaultLobHandler uses explicit Blob/Clob access for reading when "wrapAsLob"=true
* fixed JmsException/JmsUtils to fully avoid NPEs in case of cause messages being null
* fixed MessageListenerAdapter's "getSubscriptionName()" to work without delegate as well
* fixed HTTP invoker to support resolution of multi-level primitive array classes again
* introduced OXM support package (originating from Spring Web Services)
* introduced OXM-based MarshallingMessageConverter for JMS
* introduced OXM-based MarshallingView for Spring MVC
* refined @PathVariable handling in MVC handler methods
* updated Spring Portlet MVC infrastructure and mocks for Portlet API 2.0
* added resource and event methods to Portlet HandlerAdapter/HandlerInterceptor
* added resolveException method for resource requests to HandlerExceptionResolver
* introduced Resource/EventAwareController subinterfaces of Portlet Controller
* introduced @Action/@Render/@Resource/@EventMapping annotations for Portlet MVC
* added @RequestHeader support for Portlet MVC
* introduced @CookieValue annotation for Servlet and Portlet MVC handler methods
* @RequestMapping type-level param constraints taken into account consistently
* optional boolean parameters in MVC handler methods resolve to "false" if not present
* "url" macro in "spring.ftl" performs standard Servlet URL encoding automatically


Changes in version 3.0.0.M1 (2008-12-05)

* updated entire codebase for Java 5 code style (generics, varargs, StringBuilder)
* updated to JUnit 4.5 and JRuby 1.1

* removed Jakarta JSTL support for JSP 1.2 (superseded by JSP 2.0)
* removed outdated Struts 1.x Action delegation support
* removed ContextLoaderServlet and Log4jConfigServlet
* deprecated form controller hierarchy in favor of @MVC form object handling
* deprecated JUnit 3.8 test class hierarchy in favor of test context framework
