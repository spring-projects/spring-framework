/**
 * Simple implementation of the Quartz Job interface, applying the
 * passed-in JobDataMap and also the SchedulerContext as bean property
 * values. This is appropriate because a new Job instance will be created
 * for each execution. JobDataMap entries will override SchedulerContext
 * entries with the same keys.
 *
 * <p>For example, let's assume that the JobDataMap contains a key
 * "myParam" with value "5": The Job implementation can then expose
 * a bean property "myParam" of type int to receive such a value,
 * i.e. a method "setMyParam(int)". This will also work for complex
 * types like business objects etc.
 *
 * <p><b>Note that the preferred way to apply dependency injection
 * to Job instances is via a JobFactory:</b> that is, to specify
 * {@link SpringBeanJobFactory} as Quartz JobFactory (typically via
 * {@link SchedulerFactoryBean#setJobFactory SchedulerFactoryBean's "jobFactory" property}).
 * This allows to implement dependency-injected Quartz Jobs without
 * a dependency on Spring base classes.
