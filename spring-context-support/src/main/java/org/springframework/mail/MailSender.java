 * This interface defines a strategy for sending simple mails. Can be

 * For richer functionality like MIME messages, consider JavaMailSender.
 *
 * <p>Allows for easy testing of clients, as it does not depend on JavaMail's
 * infrastructure classes: no mocking of JavaMail Session or Transport necessary.
