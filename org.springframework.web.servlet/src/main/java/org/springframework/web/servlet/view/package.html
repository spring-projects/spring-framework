Provides standard View and ViewResolver implementations,
including abstract base classes for custom implementations.

<p>Application developers don't usually need to implement views,
as the framework provides standard views for JSPs, Velocity,
XSLT, etc. However, the ability to implement custom views easily
by subclassing the AbstractView class in this package can be
very helpful if an application has unusual view requirements.
