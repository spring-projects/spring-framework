This package enables automatic web controller targeting.

The only implementation at present is CommonsPathMapHandlerMapping, based on Commons
Attributes source-level attributes, but metadata implementation is pluggable.
<br>
In this model, you don't need to map URLs onto controllers in your Spring
XML web application context bean definition files. You merely need to
set one or more PathMap attributes on each of your Controller classes, and 
new objects of these types will automatically be added to the relevant
web application context.
<br>
Dependencies--whether expressed by via constructor arguments or JavaBean
properties, will be resolved if possible using the middle tier definitions in
the WebApplicationContext.

<p>
To use this feature, using the Commons Attributes implementation, perform the following steps:
<ol>
	<li>Invoke the Commons Attributes compiler on your application classes. The
	classes must be compiled into a Jar rather than the WEB-INF/classes directory.
	<li>Run the Commons Attributes attribute indexer tool on the Jar containing
	your controllers.
	<li>Use Commons Attributes syntax to define a PathMap attribute for each
	Controller you want mapped.
	<li>Define a bean of type UrlHandlerMapping in your <code>servletName-servlet.xml</code>
	bean definition file in your web application. No parameters are required.	
</ol>

<p>
You can also use other HandlerMappings, such as BeanNameHandlerMapping, in the
same servlet XML file.
