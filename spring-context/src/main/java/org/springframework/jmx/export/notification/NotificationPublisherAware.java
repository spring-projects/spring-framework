 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> This interface only applies to simple Spring-managed

 * It does not apply to any non-exported beans; neither does it apply
 * to standard MBeans exported by Spring. For standard JMX MBeans,
 * consider implementing the {@link javax.management.modelmbean.ModelMBeanNotificationBroadcaster}
 * interface (or implementing a full {@link javax.management.modelmbean.ModelMBean}).
