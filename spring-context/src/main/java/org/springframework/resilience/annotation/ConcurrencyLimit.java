/**
 * A common annotation specifying a concurrency limit for an individual method,
 * or for all proxy-invoked methods in a given class hierarchy if annotated at
 * the type level.
 *
 * <p>In the type-level case, all methods inheriting the concurrency limit
 * from the type level share a common concurrency throttle, with any mix
 * of such method invocations contributing to the shared concurrency limit.
 * Whereas for a locally annotated method, a local throttle with the specified
 * limit is going to be applied to invocations of that particular method only.
 *
 * <p>This is particularly useful with Virtual Threads where there is generally
 * no thread pool limit in place. For asynchronous tasks, this can be constrained
 * on {@link org.springframework.core.task.SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor}; for
 * synchronous invocations, this annotation provides equivalent behavior through
 * {@link org.springframework.aop.interceptor.ConcurrencyThrottleInterceptor}.
