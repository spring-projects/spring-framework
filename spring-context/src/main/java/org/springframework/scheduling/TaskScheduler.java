/**
 * Task scheduler interface that abstracts the scheduling of
 * {@link Runnable Runnables} based on different kinds of triggers.
 *
 * <p>This interface is separate from {@link SchedulingTaskExecutor} since it
 * usually represents for a different kind of backend, i.e. a thread pool with
 * different characteristics and capabilities. Implementations may implement
 * both interfaces if they can handle both kinds of execution characteristics.
 *
 * <p>The 'default' implementation is
 * {@link org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskScheduler},
 * wrapping a native {@link java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService}
 * and adding extended trigger capabilities.
 *
 * <p>This interface is roughly equivalent to a JSR-236
 * <code>ManagedScheduledExecutorService</code> as supported in Java EE 6
 * environments. However, at the time of the Spring 3.0 release, the
 * JSR-236 interfaces have not been released in official form yet.
