/**
 * Annotation that marks a method as a candidate for <i>asynchronous</i> execution.
 * Can also be used at the type level, in which case all of the type's methods are
 * considered as asynchronous.
 *
 * <p>In terms of target method signatures, any parameter types are supported.
 * However, the return type is constrained to either {@code void} or
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.Future}. In the latter case, you may declare the
 * more specific {@link org.springframework.util.concurrent.ListenableFuture} or
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture} types which allow for richer
 * interaction with the asynchronous task and for immediate composition with
 * further processing steps.
 *
 * <p>A {@code Future} handle returned from the proxy will be an actual asynchronous
 * {@code Future} that can be used to track the result of the asynchronous method
 * execution. However, since the target method needs to implement the same signature,
 * it will have to return a temporary {@code Future} handle that just passes a value
 * through: e.g. Spring's {@link AsyncResult}, EJB 3.1's {@link javax.ejb.AsyncResult},
 * or {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture#completedFuture(Object)}.
