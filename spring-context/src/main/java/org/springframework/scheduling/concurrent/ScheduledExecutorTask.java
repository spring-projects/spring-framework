/**
 * JavaBean that describes a scheduled executor task, consisting of the

 * there is no point in a default for it.

 * <p>The {@link java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService} does not offer
 * more sophisticated scheduling options such as cron expressions.
 * Consider using {@link ThreadPoolTaskScheduler} for such needs.
 *
 * <p>Note that the {@link java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService} mechanism
 * uses a {@link Runnable} instance that is shared between repeated executions,
 * in contrast to Quartz which creates a new Job instance for each execution.
