/**
 * Variant of JSR-303's {@link jakarta.validation.Valid}, supporting the
 * specification of validation groups. Designed for convenient use with
 * Spring's JSR-303 support but not JSR-303 specific.
 *
 * <p>Can be used, for example, with Spring MVC handler methods arguments.
 * Supported through {@link org.springframework.validation.SmartValidator}'s
 * validation hint concept, with validation group classes acting as hint objects.
 *
 * <p>Can also be used with method level validation, indicating that a specific
 * class is supposed to be validated at the method level (acting as a pointcut
 * for the corresponding validation interceptor), but also optionally specifying
 * the validation groups for method-level validation in the annotated class.
 * Applying this annotation at the method level allows for overriding the
 * validation groups for a specific method but does not serve as a pointcut;
 * a class-level annotation is nevertheless necessary to trigger method validation
 * for a specific bean to begin with. Can also be used as a meta-annotation on a
 * custom stereotype annotation or a custom group-specific validated annotation.
