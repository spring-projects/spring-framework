/**
 * Indicates that a component is only eligible for registration when all
 * {@linkplain #value specified conditions} match.
 *
 * <p>A <em>condition</em> is any state that can be determined programmatically
 * before the bean definition is due to be registered (see {@link Condition} for details).
 *
 * <p>The {@code @Conditional} annotation may be used in any of the following ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li>as a type-level annotation on any class directly or indirectly annotated with
 * {@code @Component}, including {@link Configuration @Configuration} classes</li>
 * <li>as a meta-annotation, for the purpose of composing custom stereotype
 * annotations</li>
 * <li>as a method-level annotation on any {@link Bean @Bean} method</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If a {@code @Configuration} class is marked with {@code @Conditional},
 * all of the {@code @Bean} methods, {@link Import @Import} annotations, and
 * {@link ComponentScan @ComponentScan} annotations associated with that
 * class will be subject to the conditions.
 *
 * <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Inheritance of {@code @Conditional} annotations
 * from superclasses or from overridden methods is not supported. To enforce
 * these semantics, {@code @Conditional} is not declared as
 * {@link java.lang.annotation.Inherited @Inherited}, and any custom
 * <em>composed annotation</em> meta-annotated with {@code @Conditional}
 * must not be declared as {@code @Inherited} either.
 *
 * <p>Conditions declared on a lexically enclosing class, however, do gate
 * registration of any nested static {@code @Configuration} classes within it.
 * This applies regardless of how the nested class is discovered: as a member
 * of its enclosing class, via {@link Import @Import}, via
 * {@link ComponentScan @ComponentScan}, or through direct registration.
 * The single exception is a nested class imported via {@code @Import} from
 * outside its enclosing class, in which case only the importer's conditions
 * apply.
