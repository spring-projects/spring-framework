/**
 * Indicates that an annotated class is a "Repository", originally defined by
 * Domain-Driven Design (Evans, 2003) as "a mechanism for encapsulating storage,
 * retrieval, and search behavior which emulates a collection of objects".
 *
 * <p>Teams implementing traditional Jakarta EE patterns such as "Data Access Object"
 * may also apply this stereotype to DAO classes, though care should be taken to
 * understand the distinction between Data Access Object and DDD-style repositories
 * before doing so. This annotation is a general-purpose stereotype and individual teams
 * may narrow their semantics and use as appropriate.
 *
 * <p>A class thus annotated is eligible for Spring
 * {@link org.springframework.dao.DataAccessException DataAccessException} translation
 * when used in conjunction with a {@link
 * org.springframework.dao.annotation.PersistenceExceptionTranslationPostProcessor
 * PersistenceExceptionTranslationPostProcessor}. The annotated class is also clarified as
 * to its role in the overall application architecture for the purpose of tooling,
 * aspects, etc.
 *
 * <p>This annotation also serves as a specialization of {@link Component @Component},
 * allowing for implementation classes to be autodetected through classpath scanning.
